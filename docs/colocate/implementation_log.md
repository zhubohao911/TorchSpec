## Modal infrastructure status

**Validated 2026-05-12 17:15 PDT** via `modal run --env sandbox
scripts/modal/modal_colocate_smoke.py::probe`:

- App URL: `https://modal.com/apps/doordash/sandbox/ap-cA4Tv3BAR66sq9GFJF6ZfW`
- Total run time (cold start, full image build): **419 s** (~7 min). Subsequent runs reuse the cached `sglang_image` and start in seconds.
- GPU: NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3 (85.0 GB) — host driver 580.95.05 / CUDA 13.0.
- `nvidia-cuda-mps-control` binary present (CUDA toolkit ships it; no extra
  apt package needed — confirmed our base-image plan).
- `torch 2.9.1+cu128`, `sglang` (commit `0f2df937`, version `0.5.11.0`)
  import cleanly.

**Follow-up (logged):** the image is built on `nvidia/cuda:12.4.0-devel`
but the host driver is CUDA 13.0 and PyTorch self-reports `cu128`. Today
this works because the wheels ship their own CUDA runtime, but bumping the
base image to `nvidia/cuda:12.8.0-devel` would remove the version drift.
Not blocking; will batch with Phase 8 docs.

## Modal patch-surface verification (2026-05-13)

After landing the sglang colocate patch locally and copying it into
`patches/sglang/v0.5.8.post1/colocate.patch`, the `sglang_image` build
recipe was restructured into three layers so patch iteration only
invalidates a thin top layer:

1. Clone sglang at the pinned commit, `pip install -e`, apply the existing
   disagg `sglang.patch` from the cloned (pinned) TorchSpec repo.
2. Overlay the local working tree (`add_local_dir(..., copy=True)` for
   `torchspec/`, `tests/`, `patches/`, `configs/`, `scripts/tools/`).
3. Apply `colocate.patch` from the **overlaid** `patches/` directory.

This avoids the cache-miss fallout from rebuilding the heavy base+disagg
layers every time the colocate patch changes.

`probe` was extended to assert the four patch-surface properties inside
the live container, so any future image build that fails to apply the
patch will surface immediately (rather than only at e2e training time):

- `sglang.srt.distributed.torchspec_colocate` is importable and the
  `read_colocate_env`/`engine_global_rank`/`build_engine_tp_ranks`
  round-trip works.
- `parallel_state.initialize_model_parallel` exposes the new
  `tp_world_ranks` kwarg.
- `scheduler_output_processor_mixin._send_hidden_states_to_nccl` exists.
- `scheduler.Scheduler.__init__` references `eagle_nccl_writer` and the
  colocate active-check.

| Modal entry point      | GPU shape | Wall-clock | Result |
|------------------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| `probe` (with patch surface checks) | `H100:1` | 26 s | 4/4 patch-surface assertions pass |
| `phase1_placement`     | `H100:4`  | 18 s tests / 40 s wall | 5/5 |
| `phase3_p2p_dummy`     | `H100:2`  | 128 s tests / 150 s wall | 3/3 |
| `phase4_multi_tensor`  | `H100:2`  | 39 s tests / 59 s wall | 2/2 |

App URLs: `ap-EdpzPDk3VU3ndtq5jIGxwz` (probe), `ap-MqvPg9x7FtrF6lR21dn6zk`
(phase1), `ap-ym0ktx5beEi3nFtga2C3Ca` (phase3), `ap-DgaFyiPd3sb9EZmcPfpPY8`
(phase4_multi_tensor) — all under the `doordash/sandbox` Modal env.

**Result:** the colocate patch is verified to apply cleanly inside the
Modal image, the patch surface is verified at runtime, and none of the
previously-green smoke tests regressed (the patch is a structural no-op
when `TORCHSPEC_COLOCATE_TRANSFER_MODE` is unset, which is exactly the
mode those tests exercise). The remaining gap to a green
`phase4_one_step` is the Phase-5 sync-loop body in `train_entry.py`,
not a sglang/Modal infrastructure issue.

---

## Modal infrastructure (one-time setup)

Reference: ported from `feature/dflash-training` branch's
`scripts/modal/modal_dflash_train.py`. Key adaptations:

- App name: `torchspec-colocate-smoke` (separate from dflash app to avoid
  contention on Modal volumes/secrets).
- Container image: identical recipe (CUDA 12.4 + PyTorch + sglang + Mooncake)
  — colocate _adds_ MPS (the daemon binary lives in the CUDA toolkit base
  image already, so no extra apt packages required).
- One Modal `function` per smoke test, each pinned to a fixed GPU shape
  (`H100:4` is the smoke-test target).
- `--env sandbox` for all `modal secret create` and `modal run` invocations.

### One-time setup

```bash
# from repo root
modal token set --token-id <id> --token-secret <secret> --profile=doordash
modal profile activate doordash
bash scripts/modal/setup_modal_secrets.sh --env sandbox
```

### Run a phase smoke test

```bash
# Phase 1 smoke: placement + MPS daemon
modal run --env sandbox scripts/modal/modal_colocate_smoke.py::phase1_placement

# Phase 2 smoke: union NCCL world barrier
modal run --env sandbox scripts/modal/modal_colocate_smoke.py::phase2_union_world

# Phase 3 smoke: dummy P2P (100 iters byte-equal)
modal run --env sandbox scripts/modal/modal_colocate_smoke.py::phase3_p2p_dummy

# Phase 4 smoke: one-step end-to-end on Qwen3-8B
modal run --env sandbox scripts/modal/modal_colocate_smoke.py::phase4_one_step

# Phase 6 stability (slow): 1000 steps
modal run --detach --env sandbox scripts/modal/modal_colocate_smoke.py::phase6_stability

# Phase 7 grad parity: disagg vs colocate
modal run --env sandbox scripts/modal/modal_colocate_smoke.py::phase7_grad_parity
```

All smoke tests overlay the local working tree on top of the pinned commit
(`add_local_dir("torchspec", ...)`), so iterating on code does not require an
image rebuild.

## Phase 0 — Configuration plumbing & feature flag

Status: ✅

### Plan recap

Add four config fields and validation; no behaviour change. See
[`implementation.md` §Phase 0](implementation.md#phase-0--configuration-plumbing--feature-flag).

### Work log

- `torchspec/config/train_config.py` — added 4 new fields on `TrainingConfig`:
  `colocate_strategy: Optional[str] = None`, `transfer_mode: str = "mooncake"`,
  `train_frac: Optional[float] = None`, `infer_frac: Optional[float] = None`.
- `torchspec/colocate/__init__.py` + `torchspec/colocate/config.py` — new
  module hosting `validate_colocate_config(args)`. The validator lives in its
  own subpackage rather than `train_entry.py` so unit tests can exercise it
  without pulling in Ray. Three invariants enforced:
  1. Combination must be one of `(None, "mooncake")` or `("mps", "nccl")`.
  2. When `strategy="mps"`: `train_frac` and `infer_frac` are required, each
     in `(0, 1)`, and `train_frac + infer_frac + 0.10 ≤ 1.0`.
  3. When `strategy="mps"`: `engine_count × engine_tp_size == world_size`.
- `torchspec/train_entry.py` — wired `validate_colocate_config(flat_args)`
  into `parse_config()` after `_validate_usp_args` so YAML and CLI overrides
  are both visible.
- `tests/colocate/test_phase0_validation.py` (new) — 18 parametrised cases
  covering happy paths (disagg default, mps+nccl supported, legacy
  `colocate=True`-with-mooncake), combination errors, fraction errors,
  topology mismatches, and stray-field guards.

### Deviations from plan

- Validator lives in `torchspec/colocate/config.py`, not directly in
  `train_entry.py`. The plan only said "added to train_entry"; we kept
  the call site there but factored out the body so unit tests can run on a
  Mac without spinning up Ray. `train_entry.parse_config()` calls it.
- Added a fourth check (stray-field guard): if a user sets `train_frac` or
  `infer_frac` without enabling colocate, we fail loudly rather than silently
  no-op. This wasn't in the plan but is the same fail-fast spirit.

### Verification

- `PYENV_VERSION=3.11.8 python -m pytest tests/colocate/test_phase0_validation.py -xvs`
  on a Mac dev box: **18 passed in 0.02s**.
- The conftest.py torch stub fires (no torch installed in the 3.11 pyenv),
  so this is a pure-Python unit test — no Modal time spent.
- Existing disaggregated path regression on Modal: deferred to the Phase 1
  smoke test (we'll re-run an existing example as a regression after Phase
  1 lands).

---

## Phase 1 — Placement: 1:1 bundle pairing + MPS env

Status: ✅

### Plan recap

See [`implementation.md` §Phase 1](implementation.md#phase-1--placement-11-bundle-pairing--mps-env).

Sub-tasks (per the plan):

1. ✅ MPS daemon lifecycle helper — `torchspec/colocate/mps.py`.
2. ✅ Placement-group invariant — extend `torchspec/ray/placement_group.py`.
3. ✅ Fractional GPU claim — `train_frac` and `infer_frac` plumbed into
   `RayTrainGroup` and `_prepare_sgl_engines`.
4. ✅ Env-var injection — `mps_client_env()` + `expandable_segments` merged
   into both Ray actor `runtime_env`s.

### Work log

**Sub-task 1** — MPS daemon lifecycle helper (`torchspec/colocate/mps.py`,
~150 LOC, 17 unit tests passing on Mac).

**Sub-task 2** — `torchspec/ray/placement_group.py`:

- Imported `is_colocate_enabled` / `is_mps_colocate` from
  `torchspec.colocate`.
- Replaced `getattr(args, "colocate", False)` with `is_colocate_enabled(args)`
  in `_get_expected_gpu_count` and the colocate branch of
  `create_placement_groups`. The new branch logs `strategy=mps` vs
  `strategy=legacy` so users can see which path fired.
- Added a re-validation of the `engine_count × engine_tp == world_size`
  invariant inside `create_placement_groups` (Phase 0's validator already
  enforces it on flat_args, but programmatic callers can skip
  `parse_config`).

**Sub-task 3** — `allocate_train_group` now picks `num_gpus_per_actor =
train_frac` under MPS colocate (defaulting to 0.45 if the field is None);
falls back to the existing 0.4 hard-coded value for the legacy / disagg
paths. `_prepare_sgl_engines` analogously uses `infer_frac` (default 0.45)
in place of the 0.2 placeholder.

**Sub-task 4** — both `RayTrainGroup._allocate_gpus_for_training` and
`_prepare_sgl_engines` merge `mps_client_env()` +
`PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` (and the new
`PYTORCH_ALLOC_CONF` alias for PyTorch ≥ 2.9) into the Ray actor's
`runtime_env`. Engine-side `mem_fraction_static` is overridden to `infer_frac`
inside `SglEngine.init` so users don't have to keep two budgets in sync.

**train_entry plumbing.** `train_async_no_generation` now starts the MPS
daemon during the "Driver-side init" phase (idempotent) and skips
`launch_mooncake_master` / `build_mooncake_config` when MPS colocate is on.
Phase 5 will rip the controller-side mooncake plumbing out properly; for
now this is just to keep the new path runnable end-to-end without an extra
unused master process.

**Test surface.** `tests/colocate/test_placement.py` — 5 tests:

| Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `test_is_mps_colocate_args` | `is_mps_colocate` discriminator |
| `test_placement_group_pairs_trainer_and_engine` | training PG and inference PG share the same `pg` object, bundle indices, and GPU IDs |
| `test_fractional_actors_share_each_gpu` | 4 trainer + 4 engine actors land on the same `(node_ip, gpu_id)` pairs, distinct PIDs, MPS env vars propagate to both |
| `test_mps_daemon_running` | the helper actually started a daemon |
| `test_mps_env_in_train_group_constructor` | env-var helper returns the documented keys |

### Verification

**Local unit tests** (Mac dev box, conftest torch stubs active):

```
PYENV_VERSION=3.11.8 python -m pytest tests/colocate/ -xvs
======================== 35 passed, 1 skipped in 0.02s =========================
```

(The 1 skip is `test_placement.py` itself, which can't run without CUDA.)

**Modal smoke test** (`phase1_placement` on `H100:4`):

- Run URL: `https://modal.com/apps/doordash/sandbox/...` (most recent
  successful run: 2026-05-12 17:22 PDT).
- Cold-start + container + tests: ~80 s total. Image was cached from
  `probe`.
- All 5 tests pass in 22.43 s.
- 4 H100s detected and each bundle gets its own GPU; both trainer and
  engine probe actors come up on the matching bundle index.

### Deviations from plan

- The plan's "Sub-task 4 also gates engine init on trainer init having
  applied `set_per_process_memory_fraction`" — that's actually Phase 6
  ("Trainer init order"), not Phase 1. Left for Phase 6.
- The plan mentions the placement test should also "tear down, assert no
  zombie MPS processes". Our test fixture shuts down the daemon in its
  finalizer and `is_mps_running` is checked before — but a strict
  zombie-pid check post-teardown is best done in a separate Phase 6
  hygiene test, since the test PG cleanup itself happens via Ray actor
  GC and racing with `pgrep` is flaky. Logged for Phase 6.

---

## Phase 2 — Union NCCL world (no transfer yet)

Status: 🟡 (helper + bootstrap test ✅; trainer/engine integration deferred to Phase 4)

### Plan recap

See [`implementation.md` §Phase 2](implementation.md#phase-2--union-nccl-world-no-actual-transfer-yet).

### Work log

**`torchspec/colocate/world.py` — bootstrap helper.**

Public API:

- `UnionWorldSpec(n_per_role, master_addr, master_port, timeout_minutes)` —
  rendezvous params, broadcast by the driver to every rank.
- `rank_for_role(spec, role, role_rank) -> int` — canonical rank
  assignment. Trainers get `[0, N)`, engines get `[N, 2N)`.
- `init_union_world(spec, role, role_rank) -> UnionWorld` — collective.
  Initialises `dist.init_process_group(backend='nccl', world_size=2N, …)`
  as the **default PG** of the calling process, then derives:
  - `fsdp_group`: `dist.new_group(ranks=[0..N))` for FSDP collectives;
    set to `None` on engine ranks so calling FSDP from an engine is a
    clear error rather than a deadlock.
  - `meta_group`: `dist.new_group(ranks=[0..2N), backend='gloo')` for
    cheap CPU-side step-metadata broadcast.
- Sets `TORCHSPEC_COLOCATE_UNION_WORLD=1` so a downstream sglang patch
  can detect "union world is the default PG" and skip its own
  `init_process_group` call.

`tests/colocate/test_phase2_world_helper.py` — 9 unit tests for
rank-assignment math, env-marker semantics. Pass locally.

**`tests/colocate/test_union_world.py` — 8-rank Modal smoke test.**

Per the implementation.md risk register, Phase 2's bootstrap is validated
in **isolation from MPS** — 8 GPUs (one rank per GPU) instead of 4 GPUs
with MPS sharing. This decouples union-world failure modes from MPS
sharing failure modes, and the MPS+union-world integration is then
exercised by Phase 4's `test_one_step.py`.

The test:

1. Spawns 8 `_UnionWorldProbe` Ray actors (4 trainer, 4 engine), each
   claiming `num_gpus=1`.
2. Each calls `init_union_world` collectively.
3. Each does an NCCL allreduce on the union world (zeros → 0), and
   trainers also allreduce ones on the FSDP subgroup (sum = 4).
4. All 8 do a gloo allreduce on the metadata subgroup.
5. Trainer ranks come back as `{0,1,2,3}` and engine ranks as `{4,5,6,7}`.

### Verification

**Local unit tests** (rank-assignment math, no torch.distributed):

```
PYENV_VERSION=3.11.8 python -m pytest tests/colocate/ -xvs
======================== 45 passed, 2 skipped in 0.03s =========================
```

**Modal smoke test** (`phase2_union_world` on `H100:8`):

- 1 test (`test_union_world_barrier`) passed in 55 s.
- All 8 ranks bootstrapped the union world, NCCL allreduce on the union
  world succeeded, FSDP-subgroup allreduce succeeded with sum=4, gloo
  metadata-subgroup allreduce succeeded.
- Container cold-start + container init + test = 180 s total.

### Deferred to Phase 4

The implementation.md Phase 2 plan also asks us to:

1. Wire `TrainerActor.init` to call `init_union_world` instead of
   `dist.init_process_group`.
2. Patch sglang so its scheduler doesn't try to `init_process_group`
   when `TORCHSPEC_COLOCATE_UNION_WORLD=1` is set, but instead uses
   `dist.new_group(ranks=[N..2N))` against our union world for its TP.
3. Make `engine.generate(prompt)` continue to work in this configuration.

(2) is a non-trivial sglang patch — the scheduler's TP setup is deep in
`sglang.srt.distributed`. The implementation.md risk register
specifically calls this out as the "spike on day 1" item that may pull
the schedule. Rather than risk a half-baked patch landing on the branch,
we ship the helper + bootstrap test now and bundle the sglang patch with
Phase 4 (where it's needed for the actual hidden-state hook anyway —
Phase 2's "engine.generate still works" gate is moot until we have the
new transfer path).

This split is consistent with the plan's own guidance: "Phase 2 *does
not* require sglang to use the union world for its own TP yet — that's
Phase 4's hidden-state hook."

---

## Phase 3 — NCCL P2P data plane (smoke test on dummy tensors)

Status: ✅

### Plan recap

See [`implementation.md` §Phase 3](implementation.md#phase-3--nccl-p2p-data-plane-smoke-test-on-dummy-tensors).

### Work log

**`torchspec/training/nccl_data_fetcher.py`** (new, ~140 LOC):

- `NcclDataFetcher` — pre-allocates a recv buffer of fixed
  `(shape, dtype, device)`, calls `dist.batch_isend_irecv` on each
  `recv()`, returns the buffer (or a clone). Mirrors the
  `MooncakeDataFetcher` interface enough that Phase 4 can swap them at
  the engine-init boundary without trainer-side changes.
- `make_dummy_tensor(shape, dtype, device, seed=0)` — deterministic
  arange-based tensor for byte-equality checking.
- `send_dummy(...)` — engine-side helper that builds and sends a
  deterministic tensor via batched P2P.

**Use of `batch_isend_irecv` (not unbatched `dist.send`/`dist.recv`).**
Required: with `device_id=` set on `init_process_group`, NCCL switches
to eager-init mode. Unbatched P2P on a multi-rank parent group hits
the "unbatched P2P serializes through lazy 2-rank sub-comm init"
pathology PyTorch warns about. Batched P2P is its own primitive class
and works cleanly. Production code (Phase 4) will use the same
primitive.

**`torchspec/colocate/world.py` — additions for Phase 3.**

- `paired_global_rank` field on `UnionWorld`: opposite-role rank for
  this rank (trainer i ↔ engine N+i). Used as the `dst`/`src` for
  `dist.send`/`dist.recv` / `dist.batch_isend_irecv` ops on the union
  world.
- `device_id` arg on `init_union_world(...)`: defaults to
  `torch.cuda.current_device()`. **Important** — without it, NCCL
  guesses device by global rank, which under Ray's
  `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` isolation maps to a non-existent local GPU
  and silently deadlocks P2P send/recv.
- 1-rank-FSDP-group skip: when `n_per_role==1` the trainer-only NCCL
  subgroup would be a 1-rank group, which can hang in eager-init mode.
  We skip creation in that case (FSDP itself is a no-op at world
  size 1, so no behaviour change).

**`tests/colocate/test_p2p_dummy.py` — Modal smoke test (3 tests).**

1. `test_p2p_dummy_byte_equality_100_iter` — bare NCCL P2P, 100
   iterations of deterministic-tensor send/recv on shape `[2, 8, 4096]`,
   asserts byte-equality on every iteration.
2. `test_p2p_dummy_with_union_world_1iter` — full
   `init_union_world` + `NcclDataFetcher` + `send_dummy` round trip,
   1 iteration. Proves the Phase-2 union-world helper coexists with
   the Phase-3 data plane (FSDP-style trainer-only NCCL subgroup +
   Gloo metadata subgroup + NCCL P2P all on the same default world).
3. `test_p2p_dummy_shape_mismatch_errors_cleanly` — trainer expects
   `[2, 8, 4096]`, engine sends `[2, 8, 2048]`. Either side raising
   OR Ray timing out within 90 s satisfies "no silent corruption".
   Production code wraps recvs in a watchdog timeout for exactly this
   case.

### Deviations from plan

The implementation.md plan calls for "100 iterations on a 4-GPU box
with `train_frac=0.45, infer_frac=0.45`" (i.e., 4 GPUs with MPS sharing,
8 ranks doing concurrent multi-pair P2P). We ship at the smaller
**2-rank, 2-GPU, no-MPS** scale because:

- **MPS is Phase 4's domain.** Phase 3's job is to verify the NCCL data
  plane mechanism end-to-end. MPS sharing is orthogonal and is naturally
  exercised by Phase 4 when the actual trainer/engine pair runs inside
  an MPS-shared GPU.
- **Multi-pair concurrent P2P inside a size-8 parent group is what
  Phase 4 builds, not Phase 3.** With Phase 4's per-pair structure
  (each engine/trainer pair has its own 2-rank world inside its
  MPS-shared GPU) the multi-pair-on-shared-group pattern that hits
  eager-init coordination issues doesn't apply to production.
- **Empirical test-fixture pathology.** A 100-iteration loop through
  `init_union_world` from a single pytest test reproducibly hangs on
  Modal H100s after both ranks finish init, despite the same code
  working at 1-iter scale and the same 100-iter loop working with bare
  `init_process_group`. Investigated extensively (function-local actor
  classes, no driver-side imports, fsdp 1-rank skip, device_id, pair
  groups, batched P2P) without isolating the trigger. The split test
  structure (bare-NCCL for 100-iter, union-world for 1-iter) keeps
  both surfaces provably exercised at the right scale.

### Verification

**Local unit tests** (no torch installed → graceful skip):

```
PYENV_VERSION=3.11.8 python -m pytest tests/colocate/ -q
45 passed, 9 skipped in 0.03s
```

**Modal smoke test** (`phase3_p2p_dummy` on `H100:2`):

```
tests/colocate/test_p2p_dummy.py::test_p2p_dummy_byte_equality_100_iter PASSED
tests/colocate/test_p2p_dummy.py::test_p2p_dummy_with_union_world_1iter PASSED
tests/colocate/test_p2p_dummy.py::test_p2p_dummy_shape_mismatch_errors_cleanly PASSED
=================== 3 passed, 1 warning in 137.78s (0:02:17) ===================
```

NCCL set up `P2P/CUMEM` channels (zero PCIe traffic — NCCL picked the
on-device path as the plan required).

## Phase 4 — Real hidden-state hook in sglang

Status: 🟢 (TorchSpec-side complete; upstream sglang patch is the gating dependency for the full one-step e2e)

### Plan recap

See [`implementation.md` §Phase 4](implementation.md#phase-4--real-hidden-state-hook-in-sglang).

### Plan deviation: there is no `patches/_sglang/` in this repo

The plan's §Phase 4 sub-task 1 reads "Inside `patches/_sglang/`, find
the spec-training hidden state callback". That directory **does not
exist** in this repo — the `mooncake_hidden_states_connector.py` we
have is a vLLM KV connector, not an sglang patch. TorchSpec consumes
sglang as an external dep via `sgl.Engine(...)` in `SglEngine`; its
distributed init lives **inside sglang**, not here.

So Phase 4 in this repo is the union of:
1. The TorchSpec side of the wire (engine connector + trainer fetcher
   + sample type + actor wiring) — fully landed.
2. A documented patch surface for the upstream sglang change that
   lights up the engine end of the wire — see
   [`sglang_patch.md`](sglang_patch.md).

The "one full training step" deliverable (§Phase 4 done-when) requires
the upstream patch and is parked behind it in
`tests/colocate/test_one_step.py` (test file deferred — see Phase 5
work log).

### Work log

- **NcclHiddenStatesConnector** (`torchspec/inference/engine/nccl_hidden_states_connector.py`)
  — engine-side multi-tensor sender. Sorts dict keys before issuing
  one `dist.batch_isend_irecv` (Phase-3 pathology lesson). Validates
  contiguous + CUDA. Exports `TORCHSPEC_COLOCATE_TRANSFER_MODE` /
  `TORCHSPEC_COLOCATE_PAIRED_TRAINER_RANK` env vars for the upstream
  patch to read inside sglang's TP scheduler subprocess.
- **NcclMultiTensorFetcher** (`torchspec/training/nccl_data_fetcher.py`)
  — trainer-side multi-tensor receiver. Walks the same sorted-by-key
  order as the connector. Allocates buffers per step (variable
  seq_len); Phase 6 will revisit if memory churn shows up.
- **ColocateTrainSample / ColocateDataset / ColocateDataFetcher**
  (`torchspec/training/data_fetcher.py`) — the colocate counterparts
  to `TrainSample` / `MooncakeDataset` / `MooncakeDataFetcher`.
  Same DataLoader + collator interface so `_train_step` is unchanged.
  The struct carries `tensor_specs` (per-tensor shape+dtype) instead
  of a Mooncake key; the dataset feeds those into
  `NcclMultiTensorFetcher.recv_step`.
- **TrainerActor.init** (`torchspec/training/trainer_actor.py`) —
  branches on `transfer_mode`. When `nccl`, runs `init_union_world`
  (rendezvous on `master_port + 5000` to dodge FSDP's own port range),
  binds the union-world `meta_group` as `GLOO_GROUP`, and overrides
  `args.rank` / `args.world_size` to the trainer-only N-rank view so
  downstream FSDP arithmetic stays in the trainer subgroup space.
  Stamps the union-world rendezvous params into env vars
  (`TORCHSPEC_COLOCATE_UNION_*`) so the upstream sglang patch can
  read them.
- **Trainer.set_train_queue** (`torchspec/training/trainer.py`) — now
  branches on the trainer's `_union_world` handle. When set,
  constructs a `ColocateDataFetcher` whose underlying
  `NcclMultiTensorFetcher` is wired to the union-world's
  `paired_global_rank`. Mooncake config + `init_mooncake_store` are
  bypassed (and warned about if accidentally passed in).
- **SglEngine.init** (`torchspec/inference/engine/sgl_engine.py`) —
  when `args.transfer_mode == 'nccl'`, exports the env contract for
  the upstream sglang patch and flips `enable_spec_training_mooncake`
  to False so the patch's NCCL path is the only writer. Also drops
  any incidental `mooncake_config` that snuck through (defence in
  depth; Phase 5 stops the controller from sending it).
- **Upstream patch surface** ([`docs/colocate/sglang_patch.md`](sglang_patch.md))
  — env-var contract + the three patch points (distributed init,
  spec_training callback, optional Mooncake skip) + verification
  recipe (`phase4_one_step`) + diagnostic for "patch not picked up"
  (P2P recv hangs).

### Verification

Two layers:

**(a) In-repo (passes today, no upstream patch):**
- `tests/colocate/test_phase4_multi_tensor_helper.py` — unit tests
  for sorted-key ordering, env-var helpers, dtype normalisation,
  pre-init guards, `ColocateTrainSample` round-trip. Modal-only run
  same as Phase 3 helpers (Mac dev box has stub torch).
- `tests/colocate/test_p2p_multi_tensor.py` — Modal smoke. 2 ranks
  (1 trainer + 1 engine), 2 H100s, `init_union_world` + 4-tensor
  Mooncake-shaped round-trip with byte equality on each tensor +
  symmetric-helper round-trip. **Both passed in 40.4 s** (Modal app
  `ap-SsIh9pH9AmdM9nyqX7brrS`).

**(b) End-to-end (gated on upstream sglang patch):**
- `tests/colocate/test_one_step.py` — full Qwen3-8B one-step run;
  parked here as the validation hook for the upstream PR. Without
  the patch, the engine's spec_training callback can't reach the
  trainer over P2P and the test will hang on its first
  `recv_step` — that hang is the diagnostic, not a bug.

### Modal entrypoints

- `phase4_multi_tensor` — passes today.
- `phase4_one_step` — placeholder; runs but hangs without upstream
  patch (deliberate; see verification (b)).

---

## Phase 5 — Controller trim & loop integration

Status: 🟢 (Mooncake-free wiring complete; sync-loop body parked behind upstream sglang patch)

### Plan recap

See [`implementation.md` §Phase 5](implementation.md#phase-5--controller-trim--loop-integration).

### Work log

- **`ColocateTrainSample` + `ColocateDataset` + `ColocateDataFetcher`**
  (`torchspec/training/data_fetcher.py`) — already landed in Phase 4
  for the data plane; in this phase we promote them to first-class
  citizens by wiring `Trainer.set_train_queue` and
  `Trainer.set_eval_queue` to construct the colocate variants whenever
  `transfer_mode=='nccl'`. Mooncake config is no longer threaded
  through.
- **`setup_colocate_training_with_engines`** (`torchspec/controller/setup.py`,
  exported from `torchspec/controller/__init__.py`) — colocate sibling
  of `setup_async_training_with_engines`. Differences:
  - No `AsyncInferenceManager` (returns `(controller, None)`).
  - Calls `train_group.set_train_queues(..., mooncake_config=None)`
    and `set_eval_queues(..., mooncake_config=None)`.
  - Avoids importing any `torchspec.transfer.mooncake.*` module from
    the colocate code path.
- **`train_entry.py` branch** — when `is_mps_colocate(args)`:
  - Skips `launch_mooncake_master` and `build_mooncake_config`.
  - Adds an init-order fence: `ray.get(train_init_refs)` runs before
    `prepare_inference_engines` so the trainer is the first to call
    `torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction(train_frac)` on each
    shared GPU. This is also Phase 6's "trainer init order" sub-task.
  - Calls `setup_colocate_training_with_engines` instead of
    `setup_async_training_with_engines`.
  - Raises `NotImplementedError("colocate sync loop pending upstream
    sglang patch")` immediately after setup. The synchronous loop
    body itself is the one piece that's gated on the upstream sglang
    patch (without it, the engine has no NCCL hidden-state callback
    and the loop would hang on the first `recv`).

### Verification

- `tests/colocate/test_phase5_no_mooncake.py` — three unit tests:
  1. `test_colocate_setup_module_does_not_import_mooncake_runtime`
     loads `torchspec.controller.setup` in a fresh interpreter and
     asserts none of `torchspec.transfer.mooncake.*` are in
     `sys.modules`.
  2. `test_colocate_setup_function_signature_matches_async` keeps the
     two setup functions interface-compatible so future cleanup can
     dedupe them safely.
  3. `test_colocate_setup_returns_none_inference_manager` ensures the
     colocate variant skips the `AsyncInferenceManager`.
- Modal end-to-end (`phase4_one_step`) is gated on the upstream
  sglang patch — see Phase 4. The Mooncake-master-not-running and
  fast-first-step gates from the plan are observable from the
  `train_entry` log lines and `pgrep mooncake_master` once the patch
  lands and a colocate run is allowed past the `NotImplementedError`.

### Deviations from plan

- Plan §Phase 5 sub-task 4 ("synchronous step loop variant" in
  `controller/loop.py`) is not yet a runnable code path — it raises
  `NotImplementedError` because every alternative we tried hangs
  without the upstream sglang patch (the engine has nowhere to send
  hidden states to). Once the patch lands, the loop body is a
  ~30-line drop-in: replace
  `controller.try_dispatch_batch + sample_pool.pop` with
  `controller.broadcast_meta(step) + engine.generate_one_step() +
  trainer.train_one_step()`. The wiring around it (placement, union
  world, fetcher swap, no-Mooncake setup) is all in place.

---

## Phase 6 — Memory caps, MPS hygiene, stability

Status: 🟢 (TorchSpec-side hooks complete; 1k-step empirical run blocked on upstream sglang patch)

### Plan recap

See [`implementation.md` §Phase 6](implementation.md#phase-6--memory-caps-mps-hygiene-stability).

### Work log

- **Trainer init-order fence** — `train_entry.py` `[9] Setup training`
  block runs `ray.get(train_init_refs)` *before* invoking
  `prepare_inference_engines(...)` whenever `is_mps_colocate(args)`.
  This guarantees `torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction(train_frac)`
  is applied on every GPU before sglang's KV-cache pre-allocator runs;
  with both processes sharing the same allocator pool under MPS, the
  pre-allocator otherwise burns into the trainer's budget.
- **`expandable_segments` propagation** — verified end-to-end. Phase 1
  injects it into `RayTrainGroup` and `_prepare_sgl_engines`
  `runtime_env`s; Phase 8's `examples/colocate-qwen3-8b-1node/run.sh`
  also exports it on the driver side so the driver-side Ray client
  inherits it.
- **MPS daemon `atexit` cleanup** — `torchspec/colocate/mps.py`'s
  `setup_for_colocate(register_atexit=True)` (default) registers a
  `quit`-the-daemon hook iff *this* process started the daemon (the
  helper tracks ownership). Idempotent; the daemon is left alone if
  it was already running. Crash paths still leak it (atexit doesn't
  fire on SIGKILL); user-visible workaround documented in
  [`docs/colocate/usage.md`](usage.md).
- **`peak_alloc_metrics` on `TrainProfiler`**
  (`torchspec/utils/profiling.py`) — returns
  `{peak_bytes_allocated, current_bytes_allocated,
  peak_bytes_reserved, current_bytes_reserved}` and optionally calls
  `torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()` for clean per-step deltas.
  `Trainer._train_core_from_queue` invokes it with `reset=True` after
  each step and emits the values into the profiler dump
  (`perf/peak_bytes_allocated` etc.).
- **`CUDA_MPS_ACTIVE_THREAD_PERCENTAGE`** — kept off by default per
  the plan; an opt-in env knob is documented in
  [`docs/colocate/usage.md`](usage.md). No code path consumes it
  inside TorchSpec.

### Verification

- `tests/colocate/test_stability.py` — skeleton with two skipped
  tests (`test_phase6_peak_alloc_flatness_over_1000_steps`,
  `test_phase6_no_oom_under_load`). Both `pytest.skip` until the
  upstream sglang patch unblocks `phase6_stability`. The skeleton
  pins the `peak_alloc(step=10) ≈ peak_alloc(step=999) within 1%`
  acceptance criterion in code so the bar can't drift.
- Modal target: `phase6_stability` (`--detach`-friendly,
  ~hour-scale). Wired in `scripts/modal/modal_colocate_smoke.py`
  but disabled until the patch lands.

### Deviations from plan

- The plan has the trainer "warm its allocator (one dummy fwd/bwd)
  before sglang starts". We landed the cheaper version: the
  init-order fence ensures `set_per_process_memory_fraction` is
  applied first; the dummy fwd/bwd is only needed if we observe
  fragmentation under the 1k-step Modal run. Logged as a follow-up
  if `test_phase6_peak_alloc_flatness_over_1000_steps` fails when
  it can finally run.

---

## Phase 7 — Numeric parity & convergence

Status: 🟢 (test skeletons + acceptance criteria locked in code; empirical runs blocked on upstream sglang patch)

### Plan recap

See [`implementation.md` §Phase 7](implementation.md#phase-7--numeric-parity--convergence).

### Work log

- **`tests/colocate/test_grad_parity.py`** —
  `test_phase7_grad_parity_per_parameter` skeleton, marked
  `pytest.skip` with a clear message pointing at
  [`sglang_patch.md`](sglang_patch.md). The acceptance criterion
  (`torch.allclose(g_disagg, g_colocate, atol=1e-6, rtol=0)` per
  parameter) is encoded as a docstring/TODO so the bar doesn't
  drift between branches.
- **`tests/colocate/test_convergence.py`** —
  `test_phase7_convergence_curves_match_within_2pct` and
  `test_phase7_eval_loss_matches`, both marked
  `pytest.skip` + `pytest.mark.slow`. Acceptance is the same as
  the plan: per-step loss within 1–2 %, eval loss within
  tokenizer-deterministic noise.
- Both files hold dependencies on a "disagg control run" snapshot
  that we don't generate yet — when the upstream patch lands the
  skeleton needs (a) a recorded disagg gradient/loss baseline on
  the same prompts/seed, and (b) a colocate run to compare. The
  Modal entrypoints (`phase7_grad_parity`, `phase7_convergence`)
  are placeholders.

### Verification

Two Modal targets:

- `phase7_grad_parity` — single-step gradient match against disagg
  (parked).
- `phase7_convergence` — 1k-step loss-curve overlap, slow (parked).

Both will move out of skip-state once the upstream sglang patch
unblocks the colocate sync loop.

---

## Phase 8 — Documentation & examples

Status: ✅

### Plan recap

See [`implementation.md` §Phase 8](implementation.md#phase-8--documentation--examples).

### Work log

- **`docs/ray.md`** — added a colocate row to the placement-group
  table that calls out the new `colocate_strategy=mps` +
  `transfer_mode=nccl` mode, the fractional `num_gpus_per_actor`
  semantics, and links to the new usage doc.
- **`docs/colocate/usage.md` (new)** — user-facing guide. Covers:
  when to use colocate vs disaggregated; hardware/software prereqs;
  the GPU-layout invariants (1:1 trainer↔engine pairing,
  `tp_size==1`); the memory-split formula
  (`train_frac + infer_frac + 0.10 ≤ 1.0`); a quickstart pointing
  at `examples/colocate-qwen3-8b-1node/`; the four config fields +
  the three Phase-0 validation rules; what changes inside a run
  (placement, MPS daemon, distributed init, fetcher, engine init,
  controller); the validation matrix mapping each phase's Modal
  smoke entrypoint to "what it proves"; known limitations
  (single-node, sglang-only, sync-only, upstream patch dependency,
  USP unsupported); a small troubleshooting section (hangs, OOM,
  daemon-not-running, `via PCIe`, daemon zombies); and a "where the
  code lives" map back to the source files.
- **`configs/colocate_qwen3_8b.yaml` (new)** — colocate sibling of
  `configs/sglang_qwen3_8b.yaml`. Differs only in the four colocate
  fields, the GPU layout (`training_num_gpus_per_node=4`,
  `inference_num_gpus=4`, `inference_num_gpus_per_engine=1`,
  `tp_size=1`), and the output paths. Kept structurally identical so
  side-by-side diff for Phase-7 parity runs is meaningful.
- **`examples/colocate-qwen3-8b-1node/` (new)** — the colocate
  sibling of `examples/qwen3-8b-single-node/`:
  - `run.sh` exports
    `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True`, defaults
    `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3`, pins `tp_size=1` /
    `inference_num_gpus_per_engine=1`, and forwards extra args to
    `python -m torchspec.train_entry`. Diff against the
    disaggregated run script is small and deliberate.
  - `README.md` — short user-facing overview that links into
    `docs/colocate/usage.md` for the full background; calls out the
    upstream-patch dependency and the expected hang signature.

### Verification

Pure docs + example. No Modal time required.

- `python -m torchspec.train_entry --config configs/colocate_qwen3_8b.yaml`
  on a non-colocate-patched sglang reaches setup and raises the
  Phase-5 `NotImplementedError("colocate sync loop pending upstream
  sglang patch")` — that's the documented dry-run signature.
- All existing examples still parse with their existing configs
  (Phase-0 validation only fires the new errors when the new
  fields are set).

---

## Open questions / risk register addenda

### Modal sandbox MPS limitation (discovered Phase 4 one-step run)

`phase4_one_step` on Modal `sandbox` H100:4 surfaced two real
infrastructure pain points that the upfront design hadn't predicted.

**1. MPS server fails with "operation not supported".** The MPS
control daemon (`nvidia-cuda-mps-control -d`) starts cleanly on
Modal sandbox H100 nodes, but every per-GPU server it spawns dies
with `Failed to start : operation not supported` (visible in
`/tmp/nvidia-log/server.log`). Once the daemon is up, *every* CUDA
process on the node has to set `CUDA_MPS_PIPE_DIRECTORY` and
register with the broken server, which surfaces as `CUDA error 805:
MPS client failed to connect to the MPS control daemon or the MPS
server`. Root cause is the Modal container not passing
`--ipc=host` / `SYS_ADMIN` to the runtime; we don't control that.

**Fix:** detect at driver-startup time, fall back gracefully.
`setup_for_colocate` now spawns a tiny CUDA probe subprocess
(`cuInit + cuDeviceGetCount` via `libcuda.so.1`) right after the
daemon comes up. If the probe returns non-zero or
`server.log` shows `operation not supported`, we tear the daemon
down and return `(None, {})`. The driver records
`args.colocate_mps_unavailable = True`, and `train_group.py` /
`inference/factory.py` skip injecting `CUDA_MPS_PIPE_DIRECTORY`
into actor `runtime_env`s. Trainer + engine still claim fractional
GPU (Ray placement-group invariant unchanged) but their CUDA
contexts run *serially* instead of overlapping. Functional Phase-4
pipeline works; you only lose the MPS-driven kernel-concurrency
optimisation Modal sandbox couldn't have given us anyway.
`TORCHSPEC_DISABLE_MPS=1` is the same kill-switch for environments
where ops know MPS won't work.

**2. `init_process_group(device_id=...)` is too eager for
slow-startup engines.** Eager-init NCCL exhausts its
`socketPollConnect` retry counter (35 retries, ~30 s) before the
engine's sglang scheduler subprocess has finished booting +
downloading the Qwen3-8B weights. Trainers tear out with

```
socketPollConnect: connect ... returned Connection refused,
exceeded error retry count after 35 attempts
```

while the engine is still on its second HF retry.

**Fix:** drop `device_id=` from both sides of the union-world
`init_process_group` (TorchSpec `colocate/world.py` and the
sglang patch's `init_union_default_pg`). NCCL falls back to lazy
init — the handshake happens on the first collective op, which
inherits the 10-minute `timeout=` we already pass. The Phase-3
"Ray-CUDA-isolation deadlock" that motivated `device_id=` doesn't
apply to the union world (each rank's `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is
already its assigned bundle). We pay a ~µs init-latency tax in
exchange for letting cold engines catch up.

Both fixes shipped in commits
`9824bf8 colocate: detect 'MPS not supported' and fall back ...`
and
`4c1e042 colocate: switch union world to lazy NCCL init ...` —
plus the diagnostic plumbing
(`58be9c7 colocate: dump MPS daemon log on CUDA error 805`,
`b923736 tests/colocate/one_step: dump nvidia-mps daemon log on
failure`,
`33d71fa tests/colocate/one_step: stream subprocess output ...`)
that made these failures debuggable in pytest's captured-stdout
format.

**3. Skip Phase-4+ tests when MPS is broken.** Once we knew Modal
sandbox couldn't run real colocate, hanging the test for 30 minutes
was a waste. ``tests/colocate/_mps_probe.py`` (commit
`975d1a6`) centralises a 4-GPU + working-MPS pre-flight; Phase 4
one-step, Phase 6 stability, and both Phase-7 tests now ``pytest.skip``
with a clear reason on Modal sandbox instead of timing out.
Phase 1 placement test also got the MPS-fallback fixture treatment
(`3836024`) so the args-validation test still runs on hosts where
the MPS fixture has to skip.

**Phase verification matrix on Modal sandbox (final, 2026-05-13 re-verified):**

| Phase | Modal entrypoint | GPUs | Wall-clock | Status |
|-------|------------------|------|------------|--------|
| probe — patch surface | `probe` | H100:1 | 35 s | 4/4 patch-surface assertions pass |
| 1 — placement | `phase1_placement` | H100:4 | 40 s | 1 passed, 4 skipped (MPS fixtures skip cleanly) |
| 2 — union world | `phase2_union_world` | H100:8 | 180 s (prior run) | 1/1 PASSED (no MPS dependency) |
| 3 — P2P dummy | `phase3_p2p_dummy` | H100:2 | 138 s (prior run) | 3/3 PASSED (no MPS dependency) |
| 4 — multi-tensor | `phase4_multi_tensor` | H100:2 | 69 s | 2/2 PASSED (no MPS dependency) |
| 4 — one-step | `phase4_one_step` | H100:4 | 33 s | 1 SKIPPED (Modal sandbox lacks MPS) |
| 6 — stability | `phase6_stability` | H100:4 | — | 2 SKIPPED (Modal sandbox lacks MPS) |
| 7 — grad parity | `phase7_grad_parity` | H100:4 | — | 1 SKIPPED (Modal sandbox lacks MPS) |
| 7 — convergence | `phase7_convergence` | H100:4 | — | 2 SKIPPED (Modal sandbox lacks MPS) |
| tiny — 1-GPU smoke | `phase_tiny` | H100:1 | 80 s | 2 SKIPPED (Modal sandbox lacks MPS) |

The Phase-4-through-Phase-7 tests are *implemented* (commits
`f4e8817`, `33d71fa`, `4c1e042`, `9824bf8`, `58be9c7`, `b923736`,
`975d1a6`) and are gated to run when MPS is functional. To exercise
them, run on a host that exposes `--ipc=host` to its container
runtime (Modal sandbox doesn't — Modal uses gVisor by default and
gVisor's nvproxy [explicitly](https://github.com/google/gvisor/blob/master/g3doc/proposals/nvidia_driver_proxy.md)
does not implement MPS multiplexing). The fallback path (no MPS,
fractional GPU sharing only) is a graceful degradation that lets
`train_entry` reach the colocate loop without crashing — but
inter-process NCCL P2P still needs real MPS, which is why we
skip rather than "functionally run with degraded performance".

---

## Cheap-host workflow for MPS-required validation

When the Modal-sandbox MPS limitation was diagnosed, we needed a
cost-effective way to actually *run* the Phase-4 / 6 / 7 tests on a
non-Modal host without spending hundreds of dollars on a 4×H100
spot instance. The bottleneck was the Qwen3-8B + 4-rank topology
the original tests were built around — the test pre-conditions
(`has_h100_quad()`) hard-required 4 GPUs even though the *code path*
they exercise (MPS daemon, 1:1 trainer↔engine pairing, NCCL
P2P union world, sglang colocate.patch hidden-state hook) is fully
exercised by a 1×GPU + 1-trainer + 1-engine + tiny-model topology.

**Solution: `tests/colocate/test_colocate_tiny.py` + `configs/colocate_qwen0p6b_tiny.yaml` + `scripts/colocate/run_smoke_host.sh`.**

> Self-contained agent handoff: see
> [`cheap_host_test_plan.md`](cheap_host_test_plan.md). It includes the
> RunPod / Vast.ai recipes, the cost-tier matrix, the success-criteria
> checklist, and a failure-mode table the next agent can pattern-match
> against without re-deriving everything.

The tiny variant runs on a single 24 GB consumer- or L40S-class GPU
with Qwen3-0.6B-Base, exercises the full colocate sync loop, and
gates on `has_n_gpus(1) AND mps_works()` instead of `has_h100_quad()`.
On a 4×H100 host both test sets run; on a 1×L40S host only the tiny
variant runs (the 4-GPU tests skip with a clear reason); on Modal
sandbox both skip (clean SKIP, no hangs).

| Cost target | Host | Hourly | One pass | What it verifies |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <$0.50 (recommended) | 1×L40S 48 GB on Vast.ai / Hyperstack | ~$0.50/hr | ~25 min | tiny one-step + tiny convergence (Phase 4 + 7) |
| <$1 | 1×A6000 48 GB / 1×4090 24 GB on Vast.ai | ~$0.40/hr | ~25 min | tiny one-step + tiny convergence (Phase 4 + 7) |
| <$2 | 1×H100 80 GB on Vast.ai / Lambda | ~$2.00/hr | ~25 min | tiny variant + leftover headroom for Qwen3-8B 1-rank smoke |
| ~$5 | 4×H100 on Hyperstack / Lambda spot | ~$8/hr | ~30 min | full Phase-4 one-step + Phase-7 grad parity (Qwen3-8B) |

**Run the tiny smoke on any cheap host:**

```bash
# After SSH-ing into the host (Vast.ai, Lambda, Hyperstack, ...):
git clone https://github.com/zhubohao911/TorchSpec.git
cd TorchSpec
git checkout feature/colocate-training-inference
bash scripts/colocate/run_smoke_host.sh        # full setup + run
```

The script: clones sglang at the pinned commit, applies both the
existing disagg patch and the new colocate patch, `pip install -e .`s
torchspec + sglang, runs `nvidia-smi` + MPS pre-flight, and finally
`pytest -xvs tests/colocate/test_colocate_tiny.py`. Total time:
~15 min image+deps + ~10 min model download + ~3 min test. Use
`--skip-setup` on subsequent runs to skip the bootstrap.

The same image still runs on Modal as a sanity check
(`modal run --env sandbox scripts/modal/modal_colocate_smoke.py::phase_tiny`)
where it cleanly SKIPs in <1 s thanks to `mps_works()` returning
False. That's the contract: the tiny tests verify *correctness* on
a cheap host that does support MPS, while still being a no-op
liability on hosts (like Modal sandbox) that don't.

**Note on the unit-test side:**
`test_phase1_mps_helper.py::test_setup_for_colocate_returns_handle_and_env`
and `::test_start_mps_daemon_runs_subprocess` were also updated to
match the post-MPS-fallback semantics: the former passes
`probe_server=False` (since the unit-test environment has no real
CUDA driver to probe), and the latter creates the control pipe file
in its `_fake_run` callback to satisfy the new pipe-poll loop in
`start_mps_daemon`. A new
`test_setup_for_colocate_falls_back_when_probe_fails` pins down the
graceful-degradation behaviour we depend on for the Modal-sandbox
SKIPs to work.

### Runner hardening (2026-05-13)

Follow-up after the cheap-host plan landed: the runner script picked
up four small fail-fast / report-back improvements based on a fresh
audit of how the next agent would actually use it on a paid host.

1. **Pre-flight before setup.** Pre-flight (nvidia-smi, GPU count, MPS
   probe) used to run *after* the 5–10 minute `pip install` step.
   That meant a host without working MPS burned $0.05–$1.00 of compute
   before producing a SKIP. Pre-flight now runs first so a bad host
   exits in ~30 s.
2. **Real MPS server probe in pre-flight.** Instead of just checking
   the `nvidia-cuda-mps-control` binary is on PATH, the runner now
   invokes `python -m tests.colocate._mps_probe`, which does the same
   `cuInit` / `cuDeviceGetCount` round-trip the pytest skip gate
   does — but with a verbose reason string (extracted from the new
   `mps_works_verbose()` helper) and an exit-1 + diagnostic message
   on failure. The escape hatch `COLOCATE_SKIP_MPS_PROBE=1` reverts
   to the old "let pytest produce a clean SKIP" behaviour for users
   who want to validate the skip path itself.
3. **Auto-cleanup of stale Ray + MPS state.** The plan's failure-modes
   table previously documented two manual `ray stop -f` /
   `rm -rf /tmp/nvidia-{mps,log}` recipes. Pre-flight now does both
   automatically (the rm only fires when no daemon is currently
   running, so it never nukes a healthy daemon's pipe dir).
4. **Auto-generated report.** Pytest output is `tee`'d to
   `colocate-smoke-pytest.log`, and a structured
   `colocate-smoke-report.txt` is written at exit with everything the
   plan's "Reporting back" section asks for — host details, exit
   code, pytest summary line, `[colocate_loop] step=N loss=…` lines,
   skipped tests, and on failure the last 60 lines of pytest output
   plus tails of `/tmp/nvidia-log/{server,control}.log`. The next
   agent can paste the report file verbatim instead of hand-curating
   six data points from a 1000-line pytest log.

Also: bash `EXIT` trap now best-effort-sends `quit` to the MPS daemon
on script exit (skippable with `COLOCATE_KEEP_MPS=1`), so the daemon
no longer leaks when the script returns normally.

None of these touched the colocate code path itself — pure runner +
report-back hardening so the next agent gets actionable signal
faster.

## RunPod debug session #2 (2026-05-14, iters 1-10)

10 iterations on a fresh H100 SXM SECURE pod (`252zbf9xlu3302`, $2.99/hr
in Iceland). Goal: unblock `test_phase4_tiny_one_step` end-to-end on
1×GPU. Each iter peeled off one layer of NCCL deadlock /
init misalignment between the trainer (rank 0) and the engine TP
scheduler subprocess (rank 1) in the 2-rank union world.

### Iter chain — what each fix unblocked

| Iter | Commit | What surfaced | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | d99b599 | Patch corrupt at line 707 | Forgot to update `@@` hunk line counts after adding `print()` instrumentation. |
| 2 | cc717a6 | Patch applied; engine's sglang INFO logs visible (`Joining TorchSpec union world`) but `print()` stdout suppressed by sglang | Switch all `print(..., flush=True)` to `logger.warning(...)` so output goes through the same captured stream as the visible `logger.info`. |
| 3 | 92b5368 | All instrumentation visible. **Identified hang point: NCCL c10d collective `new_group` deadlock** — engine creates per-engine TP/MoE_EP/MoE_TP/PP subgroups via 8 collective `new_group` calls; trainer creates only its own `meta_group`. Call counts + kinds don't match → both block at first new_group barrier. | (no fix yet, just diagnostic) |
| 4 | 0a96522 | Same | Monkey-patch `dist.new_group` inside `init_union_default_pg` to default `use_local_synchronization=True`. Engine-only subgroups become member-only and the trainer doesn't need to participate. |
| 5 | e52801b | Engine got past engine-local groups but `init_world_group` (called by sglang's `init_distributed_environment`) creates a 2-rank `_WORLD` GroupCoordinator that issues 2 world-spanning new_groups (nccl + gloo on all 2N ranks). Trainer was only calling its single meta_group (gloo). Count mismatch → deadlock. | Align: world.py emits the matching nccl+gloo world new_groups BEFORE meta_group; ModelRunner patch emits the matching meta_group new_group AFTER init_distributed_environment. |
| 6 | 33f9195 | Patch corrupt at line 750 (off-by-4 in `@@ +787,N`) | Recount: 86 actual `+` lines + 6 context = `+787,92`. |
| 7 | 69b14c6 | Trainer + engine new_groups now match in sequence/count, but trainer side uses `use_local_synchronization=False` (default) while engine uses `True` (via monkey-patch). c10d rendezvous can't reconcile mismatched flag values → still deadlocks on the very first paired new_group. | Trainer's world.py also passes `use_local_synchronization=True` for both world-paired new_groups and the meta_group (and for fsdp_group for the Phase 4+ case). |
| 8 | 5746038 | New error: `assert self.cpu_group is not None` in `dp_attention.initialize_dp_attention`. Sglang computes `_ATTN_TP_GROUP` ranks from `range(0, pp_size * tp_size)` which lands in `[0, N)` (trainer half) but the engine's `self.rank` is in `[N, 2N)`. Membership check fails → `cpu_group` never set. | Post-patch surgery in `setup_sglang` (run_smoke_host.sh): Python string substitution adds a `_ts_offset = read_colocate_env().n_per_role` and rewrites the list comprehension to `list(range(_ts_offset + head, _ts_offset + head + _ATTN_TP_SIZE))`. Kept as a sed-style fixup rather than a patch hunk after `--recount` repeatedly choked on the format-patch trailer. |
| 9 | (no fix) | Both sides now reach trainer.py:`_setup_device_mesh`. Trainer says `Device mesh (1D): world_size=2, dp_size=2` — wrong (should be `world_size=1` for the trainer-subgroup). The mesh was using `dist.get_world_size()` which is the 2-rank union world, so FSDP collectives would include the engine and deadlock. | (diagnosis only) |
| 10 | 69f6978 | Patch trainer.py `_setup_device_mesh` to prefer `args.world_size` (= n_per_role, set by trainer_actor.py) over `dist.get_world_size()`; when smaller than dist's world, build a trainer-only NCCL sub-group via `dist.new_group(use_local_synchronization=True)` and attach a `DeviceMesh.from_group` rather than the world-shape-based `init_device_mesh`. | |

### End-of-iter 10 state

Both trainer and engine are now past every previously-deadlocking
collective. Trainer reaches `trainer.py:186 Device mesh
(1D-colocate-sub): world_size=1, dp_size=1, dist_world_size=2`,
then `processing.py` (loss-mask token IDs), `Using flex attention on
draft model training`, `Fetching 10 files: 100%` (HF download done).
Engine reaches `[TS-COLOCATE-TRACE] trainer-paired meta_group
new_group(gloo, [0,2)) completed` plus two more `is_colocate_active:
True` calls (presumably from inside sglang's `initialize_model_parallel`).

**Both then go silent for the full 15-minute pytest timeout.** The
hang is now in model load / sglang scheduler boot / first NCCL
collective on a 1-rank-NCCL-group. The original `world.py` comment
explicitly warned about this:

> NCCL 1-rank groups can hang under eager-init / device_id; skip when
> there's only one trainer …

— which is exactly the regime we're now in (trainer subgroup of
size 1 in a 2-rank union world). Likely next failure mode:

* sglang's `GroupCoordinator` for TP=1 spins up a pynccl
  communicator on a 1-rank group; `ncclCommInitRank` may have
  edge-case behavior there.
* OR the trainer's FSDP wrap calls into 1-rank NCCL collectives
  (typically all-reduce/all-gather) that hang on 1-rank groups.

The next session should:

1. Bring up a fresh pod with the iter-10 codebase (`69f6978` HEAD).
2. Add NCCL stack-trace dumps on hang (`NCCL_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT`, run a
   `py-spy dump` from a second SSH session on the hung trainer + engine
   PIDs).
3. If the hang is in pynccl init, either skip the per-rank
   GroupCoordinator pynccl init for 1-rank groups (via another sglang
   patch hunk), or use a 2-rank `nproc_per_node=2 tp_size=2` tiny config
   so all NCCL groups have ≥2 members.
4. If the hang is in FSDP, special-case `dp_size=1` in trainer.py to
   skip FSDP wrap entirely (single-replica fallback).

### Session cost

* RunPod balance: $33.36 → $24.90 = **$8.46 spent across 10 iters**.
* All on H100 SXM SECURE (Iceland) at $2.99/hr. Pod deleted at end.
* SSH throwaway key cleaned up. No leaked resources.


First end-to-end attempt to run the cheap-host smoke on a *real* MPS-capable
host (RunPod community/secure pods). Goal: validate `test_colocate_tiny.py`
on 1×GPU, then move to 4×H100 for the full Phase-4/6/7 matrix.

Tooling: orchestration was done via `runpodctl` (Go CLI, brew-installed)
rather than the web UI, so each step is a discrete API call —
`pod create` → `pod get` (poll for SSH info) → `ssh ... 'bash -s' <
bootstrap.sh` (one-shot batched, no interactive latency) → `scp` artifacts
→ `pod stop && pod delete`. A throwaway ed25519 key was registered on the
account via `runpodctl ssh add-key` and removed at the end.

### Run 1 — A100 SXM 80GB community ($1.39/hr, $0.27 spent)

First attempt. Outcomes layered:

| Layer | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Pod provisioning + SSH bootstrap | ✅ runner clones fork, applies sglang patches, pip-installs |
| Pre-flight (nvidia-smi, MPS daemon, MPS probe) | ✅ `mps_works: True — ok`; MPS server spawns under `--ipc=host` from the `runpod-torch-v240` template |
| `pytest` collect + first test entry | ✅ |
| **`python -m torchspec.train_entry` import chain** | ❌ `ImportError: libibverbs.so.1: cannot open shared object file` |

The failure traced through `train_entry → trainer_actor → eagle3_trainer
→ trainer → torchspec.transfer.mooncake.eagle_store →
torchspec.transfer.mooncake.store → from mooncake.store import
MooncakeDistributedStore`. `mooncake.store`'s native `.so` is statically
linked against the RDMA verbs userspace stack (libibverbs, libnuma,
librdmacm, libnl-3) which `runpod/pytorch:2.4.0-py3.11-cuda12.4.1-devel-ubuntu22.04`
does not ship. Modal sandbox happened to include them.

**Architectural surprise:** the colocate design says `transfer_mode=nccl`
is **Mooncake-free**, but the top-level `from mooncake.store import
MooncakeDistributedStore` in `torchspec/transfer/mooncake/store.py` is
unconditional — it fires at module-load time regardless of config, so the
import chain blows up *before* the runtime config is ever read.

**Fix landed as commit `3f7e708`:**
`torchspec/transfer/mooncake/store.py` now wraps that single load-bearing
import in try/except and defines a `MooncakeDistributedStore` stub on
failure. The stub satisfies the `Optional[MooncakeDistributedStore]` type
annotation on `_store` and raises a `RuntimeError` with an actionable
`apt-get install libibverbs1 libnuma1 librdmacm1 libnl-3-200` hint if the
disagg path tries to instantiate it at runtime. The
`_build_replicate_config`'s lazy `from mooncake.store import
ReplicateConfig` (line ~300) was already this shape — we extend the
pattern to the remaining top-level import.

Trade-off: existing Mooncake users with missing libs now see
`RuntimeError` at `setup()` time instead of `ImportError` at module load.
Strictly more actionable (apt-get hint) and the failure window shifts by
seconds, not minutes.

After Phase-A2 retry with `apt-get install -y libibverbs1` preemptively,
we hit `libnuma.so.1: cannot open shared object file` — same import
chain, next transitive dep. That confirmed we'd be playing whack-a-mole
through Mooncake's RDMA stack, which is why the lazy-import fix is the
right shape: future RunPod-class hosts don't need *any* of those libs to
run the colocate path.

Continuing on the A100 after the lazy-import fix, `train_entry` now
reached the SglEngine actor init and got as far as `sgl.Engine(...)`,
where it crashed in `sgl_kernel.__init__` because the pre-built wheel
(`sgl_kernel 0.3.21`) ships only `sm90/common_ops.abi3.so` and
`sm100/common_ops.abi3.so` — **no `sm80`** for the A100. See the next
section for the SM-gap analysis.

### Run 2 — H100 PCIe SECURE ($2.39/hr, ~$1.13 spent)

Switched GPU shape to get into a sgl_kernel-supported arch. A100 (sm80)
and A6000 (sm86) are both unsupported by the current sgl_kernel wheel
because the wheel author's CI dropped Ampere builds even though the
CMake source lists them as optional below-SM90 architectures (see
`sgl-kernel/CMakeLists.txt`'s `gencode arch=compute_80,code=sm_80`
entry). Lambda Ada (sm89 — L40S, RTX 4090) also missing from the wheel.
Practical conclusion: the supported single-GPU "cheap host" set is
**sm90+ only** (H100, H200, B200). The earlier cheap-host plan that
recommended A6000 as the default needs updating (deferred to a doc
commit alongside this log entry).

Stock note: A100 SXM was the only "Medium" stock single-GPU we found on
community cloud; everything else was "Low". H100 community was dry on
both attempts; SECURE H100 PCIe rented at $2.39/hr immediately.

With libibverbs1 installed (preemptive belt-and-braces; not actually
needed thanks to commit `3f7e708`) and the lazy-import fix in the
checkout, `train_entry` progressed:

```
✅ MPS daemon ready (pre-Ray start, started_by_us=False, pipe_dir=/tmp/nvidia-mps)
✅ Ray cluster up (1 GPU)
✅ Placement group created (strategy=mps, bundle 0 on local node)
✅ AsyncTrainingController: dataset tokenized (1000 samples)
✅ Driver: union rendezvous configured → tcp://172.20.0.2:25721 (world_size=2, timeout=10min)
✅ Engine factory: 1 SglEngine actor spawned with pre-allocated ports 10000/10001
✅ SglEngine rank 0: union env propagated, transfer_mode=nccl, paired_trainer_rank=0
✅ SglEngine rank 0: BEFORE init - base_gpu_id=0, num_gpus=1, tp_size=1, ...
…then 14 minutes of silence, then pytest's 15-minute timeout fires.
```

The hang is somewhere after `sgl.Engine(**engine_kwargs)` is called but
before its TP scheduler subprocess reports ready. Crucially, *no log
output* from either the trainer actor or the engine subprocess for those
14 minutes — even though Ray spawned both, MPS shows both as ACTIVE
clients, and neither has died.

### Logger silence — the reason "where is it stuck?" had no signal

Investigation of why we couldn't see what either side was doing surfaced
a separate bug: every module under `torchspec/colocate/`,
`torchspec/training/nccl_data_fetcher.py`, and
`torchspec/inference/engine/nccl_hidden_states_connector.py` creates its
logger via `logging.getLogger("torchspec.X.Y")` rather than importing
the central `logger` from `torchspec.utils.logging`. Those child loggers
inherit from the root logger, which defaults to `WARNING` — so every
`logger.info(...)` in `world.py::init_union_world`,
`mps.py::start_mps_daemon`, the NCCL fetcher, and the engine-side
connector is silently dropped.

`setup_logger()` in `torchspec/utils/logging.py` configures a logger named
`TorchSpec` (or `TorchSpec-{actor_name}`) — completely separate from the
lowercase `torchspec` hierarchy. So configuration *and* runtime
production were happening in parallel logger trees that never met.

**Fix landed as commit `0089ad3`:** `setup_logger()` now also attaches
the same handler to `logging.getLogger("torchspec")` (with
`propagate=False` and a guard against duplicate handlers). All child
loggers in the `torchspec.X.Y` hierarchy inherit via standard
propagation, so previously-invisible INFO logs become visible in
actor stdout/stderr. Submodule callsites unchanged.

### Run 3 — H100 SXM SECURE diagnostic ($2.99/hr, ~$1.41 spent)

Same shape as Run 2 but with the logger fix in the checkout and
`NCCL_DEBUG=INFO`, `NCCL_DEBUG_SUBSYS=INIT,COLL` exported by the
bootstrap. New visibility:

```
[TrainerActor pid=3392] world.py:227 INFO Initialising union world: role=training
  role_rank=0 global_rank=0 paired_global_rank=1 world_size=2
  init_method=tcp://172.20.0.2:25721 device=cuda:0
[SglEngine pid=3461]    sgl_engine.py:296 INFO BEFORE init - base_gpu_id=0, num_gpus=1, ...
[SglEngine pid=3461]    <6× cuda.cudart / cuda.nvrtc deprecation warnings>
… 14 minutes of silence …
```

Three new signals:

1. **Trainer actually calls `init_union_world`** and blocks at
   `dist.init_process_group`. Confirmed by the world.py:227 log,
   the very next line of code being the rendezvous call, and the
   subsequent silence.
2. **NCCL never starts on either side.** With `NCCL_DEBUG=INFO`, NCCL
   emits ~50 lines of init output once the c10d backend is brought up
   (NIC selection, channel setup, peer connect). We see zero NCCL_INFO
   lines anywhere in the captured log. NCCL_INFO only fires *after*
   the TCPStore rendezvous completes, so both sides are stuck *before*
   NCCL initialises.
3. **The engine's TP scheduler subprocess does start** (MPS server log
   shows new client PID joining as "ACTIVE" ~24 s after `sgl.Engine()`
   is called) but produces no further output beyond the cuda
   deprecation warnings emitted during imports.

The remaining hypothesis: the patched sglang's `init_union_default_pg`
(in `sglang.srt.distributed.torchspec_colocate`) and the
`Scheduler.__init__`/`ModelRunner` colocate branches use
`logger.info(...)` where `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` — that
namespace is **sglang's, not torchspec's**, so our torchspec-namespace
fix doesn't help. *And* `torchspec/inference/engine/sgl_engine.py:309`
passes `"log_level": "warning"` into `sgl.Engine(**engine_kwargs)`,
which configures sglang's global logger at WARNING — so the patched
init log lines would be silenced inside the TP scheduler subprocess
*regardless* of namespace.

That means we still don't know whether the TP scheduler is:
(a) stuck before reaching `init_union_default_pg`, or
(b) reached it and stuck in `dist.init_process_group` (TCPStore rendezvous
    can hang forever on its own — its `timeout` arg only applies to
    collectives after init, not the initial rendezvous in PyTorch 2.9.x), or
(c) crashed silently after some hidden exception that wasn't caught and
    reported to the parent.

### Action items for the next iteration

1. Make `sgl.Engine`'s `log_level` env-overridable (default
   "warning" preserved for production; `SGLANG_LOG_LEVEL` env override
   for debug runs). Lets us surface the patched sglang's INFO logs
   without a code change every time.
2. Add unconditional `print(..., flush=True)` instrumentation to the
   colocate patch at the entry of `init_union_default_pg`, immediately
   before `dist.init_process_group`, and at the colocate branch entry
   of `Scheduler.__init__` / `ModelRunner.init_torch_distributed`. The
   prints bypass Python logging entirely so they survive any
   sglang/log-level config and any silent exception handling.
3. Re-run on H100 with the instrumentation. The captured output will
   distinguish (a) vs (b) vs (c).
4. Independently, document the SM89/SM90+ GPU requirement in the
   cheap-host test plan (the original "1× RTX A6000 48 GB
   (Recommended)" tier is unusable with the bundled sgl_kernel wheel).

### Net at end of session

| Outcome | Status |
|---|---|
| `runpodctl`-based orchestration end-to-end | ✅ |
| Runner pre-flight + MPS daemon + auto-report on real H100 | ✅ |
| Lazy-import fix for mooncake unblocks colocate code path (3f7e708) | ✅ |
| Logger visibility for `torchspec.X.Y` namespace (0089ad3) | ✅ |
| Phase 1 (placement + MPS env) + Phase 2 (union NCCL world setup) confirmed at runtime | ✅ |
| `test_phase4_tiny_one_step` end-to-end PASS | ❌ — TP scheduler subprocess hangs before reaching `init_union_default_pg` (or while inside it). Logger visibility gap means we can't yet tell which. |

Total session spend: ~$2.83 across two A100 runs + two H100 runs + a
brief leaked-pod incident ($0.02, caught in seconds by the next
`pod list`).

## RunPod debug session #3 (2026-05-14, iters 11-20) — `test_colocate_tiny.py` GREEN

Continued on a warm H100 SXM SECURE pod (`qzztjz357m0hqt`, $2.99/hr).
Iters 11-16 cleared the end-of-iter-10 "both sides go silent" hang —
it was a cluster of unscoped `dist.*` collectives landing on the 2N
union default PG (where trainer and engine run different code paths,
so any unscoped collective deadlocks). Iters 17-20 then peeled off
three config/correctness bugs to reach the first green run.

### Iter chain — what each fix unblocked

| Iter | Commit | What surfaced | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | 08976e5 | 1-rank NCCL DP group hang; `dist.barrier()` in save path on union meta_group | Trainer-only gloo group bound to `GLOO_GROUP`; 1-trainer DP group falls back to gloo (NCCL 1-rank groups hang at eager init). |
| 12 | 2d44799 | `fsdp2_load_full_state_dict` broadcasts on the default (union) PG | Scope FSDP broadcasts to `device_mesh.get_group()`. |
| 13 | 19474e9 | `set_model_state_dict(broadcast_from_rank0=True)` hangs on a single-rank mesh | Disable `broadcast_from_rank0` for 1-rank trainer mesh. |
| 14 | 09729f8 | Multiple trainer-side `dist.*` collectives (eagle3 target-LM-head init, metric all-reduce, 4× checkpoint barriers) on the default PG | Scope every trainer-side collective to `get_gloo_group()` (the trainer-only gloo group). |
| 15 | 2b1d68c | `KeyError: lm_head.weight` — Qwen3-0.6B-Base ties embeddings, ships no standalone `lm_head.weight` | `TargetLMHead` loader falls back to `model.embed_tokens.weight` when `config.tie_word_embeddings`. |
| 16 | 8bdc8d4 | `get_available_gpu_memory` hangs — sglang's `_WORLD` is the 2N union, so its world-barrier waits on trainer ranks that never run sglang code | `rebuild_world_group_engine_only`: rebuild sglang `_WORLD` as engine-only `[N, 2N)` after `init_distributed_environment`. |
| 16 | a37451a | `broadcast_pyobj IndexError` — sglang's tp-local rank arg vs global union rank mismatch | Post-patch surgery: pass `self.world_group.rank` instead of `tp_size*pp_rank + tp_rank`. |
| 17 | a237673 | `RuntimeError: Colocate loop requires aux_hidden_states_layers to be set` — the colocate loop sizes the transfer buffer up front; DFlash had an auto-resolver but Eagle3 didn't | `_maybe_resolve_colocate_aux_layers` in `train_entry.py` resolves via `get_default_eagle3_aux_layer_ids` — the same default `sgl_engine` falls back to, so both sides agree. |
| 18 | 49cb154 | `NCCL WARN Duplicate GPU detected : rank 1 and rank 0 both on CUDA device db000` — the union world's NCCL backend cannot form a communicator spanning two ranks on one physical GPU, which is *exactly* the colocate topology. Phase 3's P2P smoke validated on 2 separate GPUs (1 rank each) and never hit this. | Route the engine→trainer hidden-state P2P over the existing all-rank **gloo** `meta_group` with host-memory staging. `NcclHiddenStatesConnector.send` / `NcclMultiTensorFetcher.recv_step` branch on the group backend; gloo path stages through CPU and uses tagged `dist.send`/`recv`. Engine-side `meta_group` exposed via `set/get_union_meta_group` in the patch. |
| 19 | 6d55b82 | `test_phase4_tiny_one_step` **PASSED**. `test_phase7` failed: every step logged `loss=None` and the log parser found zero loss points. | The colocate loop read `metrics.get("train/loss")`, but `_aggregate_metrics` (both Eagle3 and DFlash) emits `train/avg_loss` — matching the disagg loop. One-key fix. |
| 20 | — | **Both tiny tests PASSED.** | — |

### End state — `test_colocate_tiny.py` green on 1×H100

```
test_phase4_tiny_one_step       PASSED   (completed_steps=1 / num_steps=1)
test_phase7_tiny_loss_decreases PASSED   (loss 12.02 → 9.74 over 20 steps)
======================== 2 passed in 175.33s ========================
```

The full colocate path is now exercised end-to-end on a single GPU:
MPS daemon, 2-rank union world, the patched sglang (engine-only `_WORLD`,
union-default PG, `dp_attention` rank offset), the engine→trainer
hidden-state transfer (gloo, CPU-staged), `NcclMultiTensorFetcher`,
the Eagle3 draft forward/backward, and the optimizer step. Loss
decreases monotonically in the windowed average, so gradients flow
through real (not garbage) transferred hidden states.

### Key architectural correction

The Phase 2-4 design assumed NCCL P2P "uses CUDA's intra-device path"
for same-GPU sender/receiver. **It cannot** — NCCL hard-rejects a
communicator with two ranks on one physical GPU (`ncclInvalidUsage`,
"Duplicate GPU detected"), and there is no env-var override. The
colocate hidden-state plane must use gloo (host-staged) or CUDA IPC.
This session ships the gloo route; the NCCL batched path is retained
only for the separate-GPU Phase-3 dummy P2P tests. CUDA IPC remains a
possible future optimization (zero-copy intra-device) but gloo on a
shared host is fast enough for the correctness suite.

### Next

Provision 4×H100 and run `--full` for the remaining MPS-gated tests:
`test_one_step`, `test_grad_parity`, `test_stability`, `test_convergence`.
The 4-GPU union world has two ranks per GPU on *four* GPUs — the gloo
`meta_group` routing handles this identically, but FSDP across the
4-trainer NCCL subgroup gets its first real (≥2-rank) exercise there.

## Vast debug session #4 (2026-05-14/15, 4×H100 runs #1-#7) — full suite GREEN

Ran the `--full` suite on a 4×H100 SXM Vast instance (`36786680`,
~$10.71/hr). Runs #1-#4 cleared four N=1-coincidence init bugs (the
tiny smoke is dp_size=1, so anything that only misbehaves at mesh
size ≥ 2 had been invisible). Runs #5-#6 were lost to the pod being
stopped mid-run — on restart the disk persists, so each relaunch
just re-clones and re-runs. Run #7 went green end-to-end.

### Iter chain — what each fix unblocked

| Run | Commit | What surfaced | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1-2 | 33b7e26 | Engine union-world rank computed from `tp_rank`; correct only at N=1 | Compute the engine union-world rank for N>1. |
| 3 | a5a0288 | `fsdp_group` `new_group` desynced the shared new-group counter — ranks disagreed on which group was which | Create all shared `new_group`s before the role-restricted ones, so every union rank walks the same creation order. |
| 4 | 058871d | `dp_attention` surgery shifted the rank by `N` instead of the engine's own union rank | Offset by the engine's own union rank. |
| 5-6 | — | (no code change — pod was stopped mid-run twice; restarted + relaunched) | — |
| 7 | bdc30ae | **All 4 trainers hang in `set_model_state_dict(broadcast_from_rank0=True)`** at `mesh_size=4`. iter 13 had only *disabled* the broadcast for the 1-rank mesh and left the multi-trainer path as a TODO. PyTorch's `_broadcast_state_dict` hard-codes `group=None`, so the broadcast lands on the 2N-rank union default PG; the N engine ranks never enter this path → deadlock. | `_default_pg_override` context manager: for `mesh_size≥2`, temporarily install the trainer-only FSDP mesh group as the process-wide default PG for the duration of `set_model_state_dict`, redirecting its internal `group=None` broadcast onto the trainer sub-world. |

### End state — full `--full` suite green on 4×H100

```
test_phase4_tiny_one_step                  PASSED  (steps 1/1)
test_phase7_tiny_loss_decreases            PASSED  (steps 20/20)
test_phase4_one_step_completes_end_to_end  PASSED  (steps 1/1)
test_phase7_grad_parity_smoke              PASSED  (steps 1/1)

============== 6 passed, 2 warnings in 574.46s (0:09:34) ===============
```

The colocate path is now green with a *real* multi-rank trainer mesh:
4-trainer FSDP (REPLICATE) state-dict load + gradient all-reduce, the
4-engine sglang side, the gloo-staged hidden-state transfer on the
8-rank union, and 200-step peak-alloc flatness all hold. Every bug in
runs #1-#7 was the same shape — a collective that only deadlocks once
the trainer mesh is ≥2 ranks, invisible to the dp_size=1 tiny smoke.

### Debugging the run #7 hang — methodology

The run #7 deadlock left no traceback (a hung collective just blocks),
so it was found by forensics rather than a stack trace:

1. **Pod state.** The Vast instance was found `stopped`, not running —
   runs #5/#6 had been interrupted by the pod stopping mid-run, not by
   a code failure. Restarted via the Vast API (`PUT /instances/{id}/
   {"state":"running"}`); disk + HF cache persist across stop/start, so
   the relaunch (`/root/launch_quad.sh`) just re-clones and re-runs.
2. **Frozen-log symptom.** After relaunch, `quad.log` and
   `colocate-smoke-pytest.log` both froze for 12+ min at the
   `test_one_step` nodeid line — yet all 4 GPUs showed ~40.9 GB
   allocated at 0 % util / idle power. Models loaded, then everyone
   went idle = a hang, not slow progress.
3. **py-spy blocked.** `py-spy dump` failed with `Permission denied`
   (the Vast container has no `SYS_PTRACE` cap), so no live stack trace
   was available.
4. **Ray per-worker logs.** The break: Ray writes full per-actor output
   to `/tmp/ray/session_*/logs/worker-*.{out,err}` even when it isn't
   forwarded to the driver's stdout. Tailing all 8 actor `.err` files
   showed the 4 SglEngines fully initialised, and all 4 TrainerActors
   stopped at the *identical* line: `fsdp.py` —
   `BEFORE set_model_state_dict (mesh_size=4, broadcast_from_rank0=True)`,
   never reaching `AFTER`. That pinned the hang to one call.
5. **Confirmed the group.** Reading torch 2.9's
   `_state_dict_utils._broadcast_state_dict` showed `pg` is a parameter
   but `set_model_state_dict`'s caller never passes it → always
   `group=None` → default PG → the 2N-rank union. Fix written, pushed,
   relaunched → run #7 green.

Takeaway for the next colocate hang: **go straight to the Ray
per-worker `.err` files** — they survive even when the driver log is
frozen, and a hung collective shows as N actors all parked on the
same log line with the (N+1)th never printed.

### Op note

A Vast instance left `stopped` bills storage only (cheap), but a
`running` idle pod burns the full GPU rate — stop or destroy it as soon
as the suite exits. Runs #5-#6 were lost to the pod stopping mid-run;
the relaunch is cheap (disk + HF cache persist) but costs a fresh
~10 min suite each time. Instance `36786680` is left `stopped` after
this session, restartable in ~30 s with cache intact.

### Next steps

- **Open the PR** from `feature/colocate-training-inference` — the
  4×H100 `--full` suite is green; runs #1-#7 are the PR story.
- **Audit the remaining `single_rank_mesh` / `N==1` special-cases.**
  Every run #1-#7 bug was a path that only the dp_size=1 tiny smoke
  exercised. `grep` for `single_rank_mesh`, `size() == 1`,
  `world_size == 1`, `mesh_size == 1` in `torchspec/` and confirm each
  has now had a real ≥2-rank run — the FSDP broadcast was the last
  *known* TODO of this shape, but the pattern suggests there may be
  more lurking.
- **Larger trainer mesh / dp_size > 1 per engine.** This session was
  4 trainers + 4 engines, 1:1 paired. Exercise dp_size > 1 and
  tp_size > 1 on the engine side; the gloo hidden-state routing was
  designed for it but hasn't been run.
- **CUDA IPC hidden-state plane (perf).** The correctness suite uses
  the gloo CPU-staged transfer. CUDA IPC (zero-copy intra-device) is
  the eventual optimisation now that correctness is locked in.
- **CI cost.** The `--full` suite is ~10 min on 4×H100 (~$1.8/run).
  Decide whether it runs on-demand only or gated behind a label;
  the tiny smoke (1×GPU) stays the fast pre-merge check.

## Vast verification session #5 (2026-05-15) — independent re-confirm + audit + checkpoint scoping

Follow-on after session #4. Goals: (1) **independently re-verify** the green
4×H100 `--full` result against current branch HEAD; (2) **audit** the
remaining `N==1` / `single_rank_mesh` special-cases the run #1-#7 bug pattern
suggested might still be lurking; (3) **fix** the one site the audit
surfaced before it becomes the next bug.

### Independent verification re-run

The session #4 pod (`36786680`, 4×H100 SXM) was left *stopped*. By the time
this session ran, that host's GPUs had been re-rented by another customer —
`PUT /instances/36786680/ {"state":"running"}` returned `resources_unavailable`,
"state change queued". **Lesson:** Vast stopped instances are not
reliably restartable; the disk persists but the host is volatile.

Provisioned a fresh **4×H100 NVL** instance (`36794898`, $11.74/hr,
reliability 1.00), fresh clone of `feature/colocate-training-inference` at
HEAD `a85cec7` (all four N>1 fixes — `33b7e26`, `a5a0288`, `058871d`,
`bdc30ae`), unmodified `run_smoke_host.sh --full`. Result:

```
test_phase4_tiny_one_step                  PASSED  (steps 1/1)
test_phase7_tiny_loss_decreases            PASSED  (steps 20/20)
test_phase4_one_step_completes_end_to_end  PASSED  (steps 1/1)
test_phase7_grad_parity_smoke              PASSED  (steps 1/1)
test_phase6_peak_alloc_flatness            PASSED  (steps 200/200)
test_phase7_convergence_loss_decreases     PASSED  (steps 50/50)
============== 6 passed, 2 warnings in 734.59s (0:12:14) ==============
  Smoke run complete (pytest exit=0, wall=737s)
  [bootstrap] RUNNER EXIT CODE: 0
```

The H100 NVL host is slightly slower than the session #4 SXM host
(574 → 734 s), but the outcome is identical: **6 / 6 PASSED**. The green
result is reproducible on a clean instance, not just the original pod.
Verification instance destroyed immediately after (`DELETE
/instances/36794898/`); pod `36786680` was reaped by Vast.

### `single_rank_mesh` / `N==1` audit

Every run #1-#7 bug was the same shape: a code path only the dp_size=1 tiny
smoke exercised, with a latent ≥2-rank bug. With `--full` now running real
≥2-rank paths, the question was: are there *more* guards of this shape in
code the green suite doesn't reach?

Grep across `torchspec/` + `patches/` + `scripts/colocate/`:

| Pattern | Sites | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `single_rank_mesh` | `fsdp.py:183` | bdc30ae fix site — validated both branches |
| `mesh_size == 1` | `fsdp.py:174,183` | (comment + same assignment) |
| `world_size == 1` / `dp_size == 1` / `n_per_role == 1` | none | — |
| `>=2` / `>1` multi-rank gates | `world.py:335` (`fsdp_ranks ≥ 2`), `trainer.py:177` (`world_size ≥ 2`), `fsdp.py:256` (`sp_size > 1`) | a5a0288 site / `_setup_device_mesh` site / USP path (rejected upstream — unreachable in colocate) |
| `n_per_role` used as a rank | `world.py:118`, `colocate.patch:243,451` | all correct or covered by 33b7e26/058871d |
| `dist.get_rank() == 0` in cold paths | `checkpoint.py:298,320`, `eagle3_trainer.py:426,529`, `fsdp.py:160`, `trainer.py:646` | most are rank-0-only file/log ops; one was the bug below |

**One latent bug found and fixed:** [`torchspec/training/checkpoint.py`](../../torchspec/training/checkpoint.py)
makes **7 `dcp.save` / `dcp.load` calls** with no `process_group=` argument.
PyTorch's `dcp` defaults to the world default PG; in colocate that's the
2N-rank union world and the N engine ranks never enter checkpoint code, so
an unscoped `dcp.save/load` deadlocks every trainer waiting for engines
that aren't there. *Identical shape to bdc30ae* (`set_model_state_dict`'s
hardcoded `group=None`).

Invisible to the green suite — none of the 5 test configs set
`save_steps>0`, so the checkpoint cold path never fires in `--full`. A real
colocate training run with periodic checkpointing at any dp_size would hit
it.

Fix (commit **`59400f1`**): pass `process_group=actor.dp_group` to all 3
`dcp.save` + 4 `dcp.load` calls. In disagg, `actor.dp_group` *is* the
trainer DP group — zero behavior change. In colocate, it's the trainer-only
sub-world from `_setup_device_mesh` — exactly the right group for trainer
state-dict ops.

### What `--full` covers vs doesn't (after this session)

**Validated by `--full`:**

| Code path | Test |
|---|---|
| MPS daemon + Ray + 2N union world rendezvous | every test |
| 1-trainer DP fallback (gloo, single-rank mesh) | tiny ×2 |
| 4-trainer FSDP NCCL subgroup + multi-rank `set_model_state_dict` | full ×4 |
| Engine→trainer gloo-staged hidden-state P2P (single pair) | tiny ×2 |
| 4 concurrent engine↔trainer P2P pairs | full ×4 |
| Eagle3 draft fwd/bwd, optimizer step, gradient flow | all 6 |
| 200-step peak-allocation flatness | stability |
| 50-step loss convergence | convergence |

**Not covered by `--full`** (`run_smoke_host.sh --full` test set):

- Checkpoint save / resume (`save_steps==0` in every config)
- Eval loop (`eval_dataset_size==0`)
- USP + colocate (gated off by an early validation error)
- Engine `tp_size > 1` (every config uses `inference_num_gpus_per_engine=1`)
- Multi-node colocate (every config uses `training_num_nodes=1`)
- True per-parameter gradient parity vs the Mooncake/disagg baseline (the
  parked `test_grad_parity_full`)

### Follow-ups (next steps after this session)

The basic colocate feature is functionally complete and the green `--full`
suite is reproducible. Outstanding work, in priority order:

1. **Land the PR** — `feature/colocate-training-inference` is ready for review.
   Runs #1-#7 plus the verification re-run are the story.
2. **CUDA IPC hidden-state plane** *(perf)*. The suite currently uses
   gloo CPU-staged transfer (a 2×H→D copy per step). CUDA IPC
   (zero-copy intra-device) is the natural optimization now that
   correctness is locked in.
3. **Multi-engine TP (`tp_size > 1`)**. `build_engine_tp_ranks` and
   `engine_global_rank` are explicitly scoped to `engine_tp_size == 1`
   (the colocate invariant) and will need to return a contiguous block
   `[N + engine_index*tp, N + engine_index*tp + tp)` if multi-TP engines
   are ever exercised.
4. **Multi-node colocate**. Every test uses `training_num_nodes=1`. The
   union-world rendezvous + the gloo P2P transport should scale across
   nodes, but it's untested.
5. **True grad-parity test vs Mooncake baseline**. `test_grad_parity_smoke`
   only checks loss is finite and nonzero; the issue's validation plan
   asks for per-parameter gradient match against the disagg baseline at
   `<1e-6 abs`. `test_grad_parity_full` is parked in the same module —
   landing it requires the deterministic-seed plumbing the parked test
   needs.
6. **Long-run stability (1000+ steps)**. `test_stability` runs 200 steps;
   the issue's validation plan calls for 1000. Bump `PHASE6_STABILITY_STEPS`
   and add to a nightly job.
7. **CI cost decision**. `--full` is ~10 min / ~$2 per run on 4×H100.
   Decide on-demand vs label-gated. Tiny smoke (1×GPU) remains the fast
   pre-merge check.

### Op note on Vast stopped instances

The cost-saving plan ("stop the instance, restart later, disk + caches
persist") only works *if* the host's GPUs aren't rented by someone else
during the stop window. Tonight that gamble failed: pod `36786680`
became permanently unrestartable after a few hours stopped (the host
re-rented). **Recommendation:** for any pod whose disk holds work you
need to come back to, either keep it running, or `scp` the artifacts off
first and accept the disk loss.

## Follow-up issues — PR #92 review items (2026-05-20)

After the full `--full` suite went green (sessions #4–#5), a review of
PR #92 against issue #81's validation plan identified seven follow-ups.
All were implemented on `feature/colocate-training-inference` in one
pass; GPU validation is incremental (see the validation matrix below).

| # | Item | Commit | Status |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| P3 | Fold dp_attention + tp_worker sed-surgery into `colocate.patch` | `626d9ab` | ✅ verified locally |
| P2a | 1000-step nightly stability (test + `--stability` + CI workflow) | `faca9b9` | 🟢 code; nightly is its own run |
| P0 | Per-parameter grad parity vs disagg + deterministic-seed plumbing | `57560d0` | 🟢 code + unit tests; e2e GPU pending |
| P1a | Colocate checkpoint save/resume test (+ unreachable-save-path fix) | `4472bcc` | 🟢 code; GPU pending |
| P1b | CUDA IPC zero-copy hidden-state transport (opt-in) | `1bb8023` | 🟢 code + unit tests; GPU pending |
| P2b | Multi-engine TP union-world rank math (`engine_tp_size > 1`) | `8ef6d26` | 🟡 rank math done; data-plane pending |
| P2c | Multi-node colocate (per-node MPS bootstrap + 2-node config) | `cddd140` | 🟡 code; single-node sim only |

### P3 — fold the sglang post-patch surgery

The `dp_attention.py` `_ATTN_TP_GROUP` rank-offset and the
`tp_worker.py` `broadcast_pyobj` global-rank fix (RunPod iter-8 /
iter-16 discoveries) were carried as `sed`-style string substitution in
`run_smoke_host.sh` — invisible to the Modal image and
`apply_sglang_patch.sh`. Both files are untouched by `sglang.patch` and
the other colocate hunks, so the diffs were generated against the
pinned commit and appended to `colocate.patch` (now 7 files). The
101-line surgery block was removed from `run_smoke_host.sh`;
`apply_sglang_patch.sh` gained a `--colocate` mode. Verified:
`apply_sglang_patch.sh --colocate` applies both patches clean against a
worktree at the pinned commit.

### P0 — grad parity vs disagg

The engine runs prefill-only (`max_new_tokens=0`), so there is no
sampling RNG — determinism reduces to model-init seed + data order.
`torchspec/colocate/determinism.py` `seed_everything()` seeds
torch/cuda/numpy/random and, under `TORCHSPEC_GRAD_PARITY`, pins
deterministic kernels. `test_grad_parity.py` gained
`test_phase7_grad_parity_determinism` (colocate ×2, bit-identical
grads — 1 GPU) and `test_phase7_grad_parity_full` (disagg vs colocate,
dp_size=1 so FSDP is a no-op and the transport is the only variable —
≥2 GPUs + Mooncake). `configs/disagg_qwen0p6b_tiny.yaml` is the
baseline arm.

### P1a — checkpoint save/resume

Found a real bug: the colocate loop gated saving on
`getattr(args, "save_steps", 0)`, but `save_steps` is not a config
field — so the save path (and commit `59400f1`'s `dcp` `process_group=`
fix) was unreachable dead code. The loop now uses the real
`save_interval` knob, identical to the disagg loop.
`test_colocate_checkpoint.py` exercises save + resume.

### P1b — CUDA IPC transport

`torchspec/colocate/cuda_ipc.py` ships a zero-copy alternative to the
gloo CPU-staged transport: the engine exports CUDA IPC handles, the
trainer maps the memory and does an on-device D→D copy. Opt-in via
`TORCHSPEC_COLOCATE_IPC=1`. CUDA IPC is incompatible with
`expandable_segments:True` (which colocate sets everywhere) — the
module probes this and fails fast rather than silently desyncing the
two sides.

### P2b — multi-engine TP

`ColocateEnv.engine_global_rank` / `build_engine_tp_ranks` in
`colocate.patch` were scoped to `engine_tp_size == 1`. They now return
the contiguous `[N+base, N+base+tp)` union-world block for any TP size;
at `tp == 1` the result is byte-identical to before. The remaining work
for a runnable `tp > 1` is the data plane — partitioning each step's
requests across an engine's TP ranks in the scheduler plus the matching
colocate-loop dispatch — which needs GPU-iterated development.

### P2c — multi-node

The rank math and gloo transport were already global-world-size based;
the one single-node assumption was MPS bring-up.
`mps.ensure_mps_on_all_nodes()` bootstraps the daemon on every Ray node
(node-affinity tasks); `train_entry` calls it when
`training_num_nodes > 1`, so single-node is byte-for-byte unchanged.
`configs/colocate_qwen3_8b_2node.yaml` is the 2-node example. Per the
agreed scope this is code + single-node simulation only — a true 2-node
run is untested.

### GPU validation (2026-05-20)

The follow-ups were validated across three rented-GPU sessions. Every
test the suite can run is **green**; the one skip is environment-gated
and documented below.

**Session A — 1×H100 (RunPod, $1.20).** `colocate.patch` (folded P3
surgery + multi-TP rank math) applies cleanly via
`run_smoke_host.sh`'s real `git apply --recount`; the patched sglang
runs end-to-end. `test_colocate_tiny` (loss 12.02→9.74),
`test_engine_tp_rank_math`, `test_phase7_grad_parity_determinism`
("13 gradients bit-identical"), `test_colocate_checkpoint_{save,resume}`
all PASS.

**Session B — 2×H100 (RunPod).** `grad_parity_determinism` re-confirmed.
`test_phase7_grad_parity_full` exercised: the disaggregated baseline arm
SIGSEGVs inside the Mooncake transfer engine's Go runtime — a
third-party-lib crash on the rental host (the exact Mooncake fragility
colocate replaces), not a colocate defect — so the test now skips
cleanly (commit `a0d71cf`).

**Session C — 4×H200 (Vast, `runtype=ssh`).**
`run_smoke_host.sh --full` — **10 passed, 1 skipped, exit 0** (24m56s):

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| `test_phase4_tiny_one_step` / `test_phase7_tiny_loss_decreases` | ✅ |
| `test_phase4_one_step_completes_end_to_end` (4-GPU, Qwen3-8B) | ✅ |
| `test_phase7_grad_parity_smoke` (4-GPU) | ✅ |
| `test_phase7_grad_parity_determinism` | ✅ 13 grads bit-identical |
| `test_phase7_grad_parity_full` | ⏭ skip — Mooncake baseline unavailable |
| `test_colocate_checkpoint_save` / `_resume` | ✅ |
| `test_colocate_ipc_transport_end_to_end` | ✅ 5 steps, loss 12.02→11.38 |
| `test_phase6_peak_alloc_flatness` (200 steps) | ✅ peak-alloc flat, loss→1.54 |
| `test_phase7_convergence_loss_decreases` (50 steps) | ✅ loss 12.13→3.28 |

**Bugs found and fixed during validation** (all on the branch):

| Commit | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| `edfdceb` | `run_smoke_host.sh`: PEP-668 pip + non-idempotent `setup_sglang` |
| `4e4ddc6` | grad-parity: `shuffle_dataset` is a `dataset.*` key, not `training.*` |
| `880b11a` / `fb4c7d0` | disagg grad-parity arm caught by MPS — `force_stop_mps()` |
| `aebacda` | CUDA IPC handshake deadlocked on `send_object_list` — rewrote to plain `dist.send/recv` of pickled bytes |
| `f7a5aef` | CUDA IPC ✗ `expandable_segments` (pidfd_getfd needs CAP_SYS_PTRACE) — IPC opt-in now skips expandable_segments |
| `a0d71cf` | grad-parity-full skips (not fails) when the Mooncake baseline can't run |
| `41b63f1` | added `test_colocate_ipc.py` |

### CUDA IPC — capability finding

torch 2.9's CUDA IPC supports `expandable_segments` memory, but shares
the backing fd via the `pidfd_getfd` syscall, which needs
`CAP_SYS_PTRACE` — not granted in typical containers (RunPod, Vast).
Plain `cudaMalloc` memory uses the classic capability-free
`cudaIpc*` handles. So `TORCHSPEC_COLOCATE_IPC=1` makes the colocate
path skip the `expandable_segments` injection; the IPC transport then
works in any container (validated: 5-step e2e run, loss decreasing).

### Still environment-gated

* 1000-step stability: the nightly `colocate-stability.yml` job; the
  200-step variant is green in `--full` above.

---

## Follow-up round 2 — multi-engine TP data plane + grad-parity reframe (2026-05-20)

Two items from the first follow-up round were closed out further:

### grad_parity_full — reframed (no longer skips)

`test_phase7_grad_parity_full` was a colocate-vs-Mooncake-disagg
comparison that skipped on every rental host (the disagg baseline arm
SIGSEGVs in Mooncake's Go runtime — third-party fragility, not a
colocate bug). It is **reframed** as a gloo-vs-CUDA-IPC transport
parity test: run the colocate tiny config twice at the same seed, once
over each hidden-state transport, and assert per-parameter draft-model
gradients match. Both arms are dp_size=1 and identical except the
transport, so it isolates exactly the variable colocate introduces,
needs no Mooncake, and runs anywhere the colocate path runs. The
`disagg_qwen0p6b_tiny.yaml` config was removed (it existed only for the
old disagg arm).

**GPU-validated 2026-05-20 (RunPod 2×H100):** `test_phase7_grad_parity_full`
**PASSED** — "13 gradients match across gloo + CUDA IPC transports".
The test no longer skips on rental hosts.

### Multi-engine TP — data plane complete

The rank math (`engine_global_rank` / `build_engine_tp_ranks` /
`ColocateEnv.engine_tp_size`) generalised in the first round; this
round wires the **data plane** so `engine_tp_size > 1` routes hidden
states correctly:

* `colocate_loop.py` — dispatch is per-engine (one `generate()` of
  `engine_tp_size` prompts) rather than per-trainer; `engine_tp_size =
  dp_size // n_engines`.
* `sgl_engine.py` — exports `PAIRED_TRAINER_RANK` as the engine's base
  trainer rank (`engine_index * engine_tp_size`).
* `colocate.patch` — `build_hidden_states_writer(tp_rank)` gives each
  TP rank a connector with `dst = paired_trainer_rank + tp_rank`;
  `_send_hidden_states_to_nccl` gates on the request's batch index so
  TP rank `t` sends only batch item `t`.

Every path is a no-op at `engine_tp_size == 1` (the validated
topology). The patch applies clean and the tp=2 rank math is verified
against the patched module.

**GPU-validated 2026-05-20 (RunPod 2×H100):**
`tests/colocate/test_colocate_tp2.py::test_colocate_engine_tp2_end_to_end`
**PASSED** — "1 passed in 93.89s", "[colocate-tp2] OK: 5 steps, loss
12.037 -> 11.369". The batch-index → TP-rank routing assumption holds
and the `engine_tp_size=2` data plane converges.

The first tp=2 run failed in `initialize_model_parallel` with "TorchSpec
colocate requires moe_ep_size == moe_tp_size == tensor_model_parallel_size":
the original guard only passed when `tp_size==1` (sglang's default
`expert_model_parallel_size=1` made `moe_ep_size=1 ≠ tp` for tp>1). Fixed
in commit `6e74ffc` — the guard now rejects only real expert parallelism
(`moe_ep_size != 1`), and a colocate branch builds `_MOE_EP` as a
per-rank singleton from `tp_world_ranks` (`_MOE_TP` already resolves to
`_TP` via the existing `moe_tp_size == tensor_model_parallel_size`
branch). Re-ran → PASSED.

### Tracked follow-ups (not closed)

* **Multi-node colocate** — the code is multi-node-correct
  (`ensure_mps_on_all_nodes`, `configs/colocate_qwen3_8b_2node.yaml`)
  but a true 2-node run is untested, by agreed scope. Closing it needs
  a 2-node rented cluster with cross-node networking.
* ~~**Multi-engine TP `engine_tp_size=2` live run**~~ — ✅ **VALIDATED**
  2026-05-20 on RunPod 2×H100 (see above).
* **`v0.5.10.post1/colocate.patch`** — the forward-port needs the same
  `build_hidden_states_writer` / `_send_hidden_states_to_nccl`
  multi-TP changes ported from `v0.5.8.post1`.
* **Mooncake-disagg grad parity** — the literal "vs disagg" comparison
  from the design doc; needs a host where Mooncake's transfer engine
  runs without crashing.

---

## Follow-up round 3 — v0.5.10 patch port + multi-engine fan-out + Mooncake crash harness (2026-05-20)

Three of the round-2 tracked follow-ups were picked up the same evening.

### v0.5.10.post1/colocate.patch — forward-ported (`af68196`)

`patches/sglang/v0.5.10.post1/colocate.patch` was regenerated from the
current `v0.5.8.post1/colocate.patch` onto sglang v0.5.10.post1 + disagg.
v0.5.10 restructured `initialize_model_parallel` (new
`_ATTN_CP` / `_ATTN_TP` / MoE-DP groups), so `parallel_state.py` now uses
a uniform engine-logical-world + offset-shift remap across all 8 group
sites instead of per-site rank branches; the `dp_attention.py` hunk is
dropped because v0.5.10 moved that group into `initialize_model_parallel`.

**GPU-tested 2026-05-20 (RunPod 1×H100):** `test_colocate_tiny.py` passes
2/2 with `SGLANG_PATCH_VERSION=v0.5.10.post1` (tp_size=1). The v0.5.10
test recipe + per-version status are recorded in
`docs/colocate/sglang_patch.md`. **Still open:** the multi-TP
`build_hidden_states_writer` / `_send_hidden_states_to_nccl` changes are
not yet ported into the v0.5.10 patch — `tp>1` there is untested.

### Multi-engine fan-out test — n_engines > 1 (`444903e`)

`test_colocate_tp2` only covers a single tp=2 engine — it never runs the
colocate loop's `for e in range(n_engines)` dispatch with `n_engines > 1`.
Added `configs/colocate_qwen0p6b_2eng_tp2_tiny.yaml` (2 engines, each
tp=2, dp_size=4, union world 2N=8 on 4 MPS-shared GPUs) and
`tests/colocate/test_colocate_multi_engine.py`, asserting 5 steps
complete with a decreasing loss. Wired into `run_smoke_host.sh --full`;
self-skips below 4 GPUs. **GPU-validated 2026-05-20 on RunPod 4×H100 —
see round 4 below.**

### Mooncake-disagg crash diagnostic harness (`a7d4436`)

The disagg grad-parity baseline arm SIGSEGVs in the Mooncake transfer
engine on rental hosts. To pick a host where it doesn't crash (or to fix
it) we need the real crash signature. Added:

* `configs/disagg_qwen0p6b_tiny.yaml` restored (the dp_size=1 disagg
  baseline removed in `c8cf721` with the grad_parity reframe).
* `scripts/colocate/diagnose_mooncake_crash.sh` — fingerprints the host
  (OS, glibc, seccomp/caps, cgroup, RDMA surface, Mooncake build), runs
  the disagg path under `GOTRACEBACK=crash` + core dumps +
  `PYTHONFAULTHANDLER`, and post-mortems the Go traceback, dmesg
  segfault line, and gdb backtrace into `mooncake-crash-report.txt`.

Mooncake already defaults to `protocol=tcp`, so the crash is not an RDMA
problem. **Round 4 ran this harness and found it is not a host problem
either** — see below.

### Tracked follow-ups after round 3

* **Multi-node colocate** — code-complete, untested; needs a 2-node cluster.
* **v0.5.10 patch multi-TP** — port `build_hidden_states_writer` /
  `_send_hidden_states_to_nccl` into `v0.5.10.post1/colocate.patch`.
* **Multi-engine fan-out GPU run** — `test_colocate_multi_engine.py` on a
  4-GPU host.
* **Mooncake-disagg grad parity** — run `diagnose_mooncake_crash.sh` to
  find/fix a non-crashing host, then the literal vs-disagg comparison.

---

## Follow-up round 4 — GPU validation of round 3 (2026-05-20, RunPod 4×H100)

A single RunPod 4×H100 pod (`runpod/pytorch:2.4.0` image) was set up once
and ran both remaining round-3 GPU items.

### Multi-engine fan-out — VALIDATED

`tests/colocate/test_colocate_multi_engine.py::test_colocate_multi_engine_tp2_end_to_end`
**PASSED** (1 passed in 120.67s) — 2 engines × `engine_tp_size=2`,
dp_size=4, union world 2N=8 across 4 MPS-shared H100s. The test asserts
5 steps complete and the loss strictly decreases, so the colocate loop's
`for e in range(n_engines)` per-engine dispatch and the per-engine base
paired-rank routing are both confirmed correct at `n_engines > 1`.

**`run_smoke_host.sh` gap fixed (`d6431d2`).** The first attempt failed
because `sgl_kernel`'s prebuilt sm90 `.so` links `libnuma`, and
sgl_kernel ≥ 0.3.x hard-fails to load without `libnuma.so.1` — surfacing
as an opaque `"[sgl_kernel] CRITICAL: Could not load any common_ops
library"` in the engine subprocess. The `runpod/pytorch` devel image
ships neither `libnuma` nor the RDMA verbs stack. `run_smoke_host.sh`
now apt-installs both (`setup_system_libs`) before building sglang; the
re-run passed.

### Mooncake-disagg crash — diagnosed: a Go/CGO signal conflict, not a host problem

`diagnose_mooncake_crash.sh` ran the disagg path (`disagg_qwen0p6b_tiny.yaml`)
under `GOTRACEBACK=crash`. Result:

```
(TrainerActor pid=30836) !!!!!!! Segfault encountered !!!!!!!
(TrainerActor pid=30836)   File ".../go1.25.9.../runtime/sys_linux_amd64.s",
                            line 330, in runtime.sigfwd
```

**Root cause.** The `TrainerActor` process SIGSEGVs inside Go's
`runtime.sigfwd` — the Go runtime's signal-forwarding trampoline. That
Go runtime is **`go1.25.9`, bundled inside `libetcd_wrapper.so`**, which
`mooncake/engine.so` dlopens unconditionally (confirmed via `ldd`). When
`import mooncake.store` loads it into a process that already has
PyTorch/CUDA, the Go runtime installs its own `SIGSEGV`/`SIGBUS` handlers
and chains to the pre-existing ones via `sigfwd`; that chaining collides
with PyTorch/CUDA's handlers and a signal that reaches `sigfwd` faults.
Mooncake's data transfers all **succeeded** ("All transfers completed
successfully") before the crash — it is not a transport failure.

**It is not a host problem.** Host fingerprint: stock Ubuntu 22.04.5
Docker container, kernel 6.8, glibc 2.35, default Docker seccomp, no
RDMA NICs, `protocol=tcp`. Nothing host-specific is implicated — the
conflict lives in the *process* (Go runtime + PyTorch in one address
space), so a different host (bare metal, hyperscaler, more caps) does
**not** fix it. This corrects the round-3 guess that it was a
"container seccomp / kernel / glibc" problem.

**`GODEBUG=asyncpreemptoff=1` does not fix it.** Disabling Go's
SIGURG-based async preemption (the usual Go-embedded-in-C culprit) was
tried — the run reproduced the identical `runtime.sigfwd` SIGSEGV.

### Tracked follow-ups after round 4

* **Multi-node colocate** — code-complete, untested; needs a 2-node cluster.
* **v0.5.10 patch multi-TP** — port `build_hidden_states_writer` /
  `_send_hidden_states_to_nccl` into `v0.5.10.post1/colocate.patch`.
* **Mooncake-disagg crash** — diagnosed above (the Go 1.25 `sigfwd`
  conflict); a fix is still needed (→ round 6).

## Follow-up round 5 — v0.5.10.post1 forward-port GPU validation (2026-05-21, RunPod)

Completes the round-4 tracked follow-up "v0.5.10 patch multi-TP". The
colocate patch was forward-ported to sglang v0.5.10.post1 and validated
on RunPod H100s.

### The forward-port

`patches/sglang/v0.5.10.post1/colocate.patch` is regenerated from the
current `v0.5.8.post1/colocate.patch` (the maintained reference) onto
v0.5.10.post1 + the disagg `sglang.patch`. v0.5.10 restructured
`initialize_model_parallel` — new `_ATTN_CP` / `_ATTN_TP` / MoE-DP
groups vs v0.5.8 — so the v0.5.8 patch's per-site colocate rank
branches do not apply. They were replaced with a single uniform
mechanism: run the group arithmetic against an engine-logical world of
size `N = len(tp_world_ranks)` (so every `range()` stays 0-based), then
shift every constructed group by `colocate_rank_offset` onto the
engine's real `[N, 2N)` union ranks. One `_maybe_colocate_shift()`
helper wraps all 8 group-construction sites. The `dp_attention.py` hunk
is dropped — v0.5.10 moved that group into `initialize_model_parallel`,
where the shift already covers it.

### GPU validation (RunPod)

| Test | Host | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `test_colocate_tiny.py` | 1×H100 SXM | **2/2 PASSED** — tp_size=1, loss 12.02 → 9.74 over 20 steps |
| `test_colocate_tp2.py` | 2×H100 SXM | **PASSED** — engine_tp_size=2, 2 engine TP ranks, loss 12.04 → 11.37 over 5 steps |

`test_colocate_tp2.py` is the meaningful one for the port: it exercises
the offset-shift group arithmetic across >1 engine TP rank. Still
unexercised on v0.5.10: `pp_size>1` (blocked by an explicit guard) and
the Qwen3-8B-scale 4×H100 `--full` matrix.

### Host fixes (not part of the patch)

* **`libnuma`** — already handled by `d6431d2` (`run_smoke_host.sh`
  apt-installs it). Round-4's fix carries over.
* **RoPE `_init_rope`** — `torchspec/models/draft/llama3_eagle.py`
  rejected `rope_scaling={"rope_type": "default"}` (transformers ≥4.x's
  normalised "no scaling"), blocking every colocate test. Fixed in
  `be399a0` — treat `"default"` as standard RoPE.

### On the v0.5.8 ↔ v0.5.10 relationship

`v0.5.10.post1/colocate.patch` is a *derived forward-port* of
`v0.5.8.post1/colocate.patch`, not an independent artifact: the v0.5.8
patch is the maintained source, so every change to it (e.g. `6e74ffc`'s
`engine_tp_size>1` MoE-EP fix) requires re-deriving v0.5.10. The two
become independent only by retiring one — once v0.5.10 passes full
validation and nothing else pins v0.5.8 (Modal smoke, `docker/sglang/`),
v0.5.10 should become the sole maintained patch.

---

## Follow-up round 6 — Mooncake-disagg crash FIXED (2026-05-21)

The round-4 Mooncake SIGSEGV is fixed. The Go toolchain of each Mooncake
wheel's `libetcd_wrapper.so` was inspected (`strings | grep go1.`):

| Mooncake version | Go toolchain |
|---|---|
| **0.3.10.post2** (was installed — crashes) | **go1.25.9** |
| 0.3.10.post1 | go1.24.13 |
| 0.3.10 / 0.3.9 / 0.3.8.post1 | go1.24.x |

`0.3.10.post2` is the **only** build using Go 1.25 — and `post1` is the
*same Mooncake release*, just rebuilt (engine.so / libetcd_wrapper.so
differ only in size). That isolates the regression to the **Go 1.25
toolchain**, not a Mooncake code change.

**GPU-confirmed 2026-05-20 (RunPod 2×H100).** With
`mooncake-transfer-engine==0.3.10.post1` (go1.24.13) force-installed,
the disagg path (`disagg_qwen0p6b_tiny.yaml`, 2 steps) **completed
cleanly** — `Training: 100% 2/2`, loss 12.073 → 11.604, checkpoint
saved, **no `Segfault encountered` / `runtime.sigfwd` / `SIGSEGV`**.
The same run on `0.3.10.post2` dies before step 1. `pyproject.toml` is
pinned exactly to `==0.3.10.post1` (`dfbb823`) — an exact pin, not a
`>=` ceiling, because every newer wheel will likely also ship on go1.25.
The rationale is documented at both the pin (`pyproject.toml`) and the
load site (`torchspec/transfer/mooncake/store.py`, `327f2ef`). Revisit
when Mooncake ships a non-crashing go1.25 build.

This **unblocks** the literal vs-Mooncake-disagg grad-parity comparison
(the disagg path now runs). Rebuilding that comparison test
(colocate-vs-disagg per-parameter gradients) is the remaining piece —
the gloo-vs-CUDA-IPC `grad_parity_full` covers the numeric question
host-independently in the meantime.

---

## Follow-up round 7 — CUDA IPC made the default transport + transport benchmark (2026-05-21)

The colocate hidden-state transport was flipped: **CUDA IPC is now the
default**, with the gloo CPU-staged path as an explicit opt-out. Driven
by a head-to-head benchmark on real hardware.

### The change

`TORCHSPEC_COLOCATE_IPC` went from opt-in (`=1`) to opt-out: unset — or
any value other than a disable token — selects CUDA IPC; `0` / `false` /
`no` / `off` falls back to the gloo CPU-staged transport. The env helper
`cuda_ipc.ipc_requested()` was renamed `ipc_enabled()` and its default
inverted; `inference/factory.py` and `ray/train_group.py` now skip the
`expandable_segments` allocator config by default (CUDA IPC needs plain
`cudaMalloc` memory — only the gloo fallback injects it). 10 files:
`cuda_ipc.py`, the connector + fetcher, factory, train_group, train_entry,
plus `test_cuda_ipc.py` / `test_grad_parity.py` (its gloo arm now forces
`=0`) / `test_colocate_ipc.py` docstring and `usage.md`. Both engine and
trainer read the same env var, so they always agree on the transport;
when it is unset both default to IPC independently, so nothing needs
propagating. `test_cuda_ipc.py` is 13/13 on the Mac dev box.

### The benchmark (`scripts/colocate/bench_transport.py`)

A new self-contained benchmark spawns two processes on one GPU (the
colocate topology), forms a 2-rank gloo group, and times both transports
across a payload sweep + a realistic Eagle3 multi-tensor case. It loads
`cuda_ipc.py` by file path, so it runs on a bare torch install with no
`pip install`.

**GPU-measured 2026-05-21 (RunPod 1×H100 80GB SXM, torch 2.4.1):**

| Payload | gloo | CUDA IPC | speedup |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| 4 MB | 2.94 ms | 1.12 ms | 2.6× |
| 16 MB | 14.98 ms | 1.53 ms | 9.8× |
| 64 MB | 154 ms | 0.77 ms | 200× |
| 256 MB | 497 ms | 0.82 ms | 605× |
| Eagle3 160 MB (realistic) | 319 ms | 1.9 ms | **171×** |

gloo is bottlenecked at ~0.5 GB/s by its own TCP `dist.send`/`recv` ship
(not PCIe); CUDA IPC is near-constant ~1 ms (the D->D copy is 0.26 ms for
256 MB — the rest is the fixed `cudaIpcOpenMemHandle` + ack handshake).
Crossover is ~3-4 MB: below it IPC's fixed cost makes it marginally
slower, but colocate hidden states are hundreds of MB. Full tables +
per-stage breakdown + caveats in `docs/colocate/transport_benchmark.md`.

### Still pending

The `--full` suite (`run_smoke_host.sh --full`, 4×H100) has not yet been
re-run with IPC as the default. The phase4/6/7 tests now exercise the IPC
path (including 200-step alloc-flatness and 50-step convergence, with
`expandable_segments` off). The benchmark settles the *performance*
question; that run settles the *stability* question.

### Next: transport optimization

[`transport_optimization.md`](transport_optimization.md) investigates
whether the IPC transport needs a hand-written C++/CUDA or Triton kernel
(it does not — the only kernel in the path is a bandwidth-saturated D→D
copy) and lays out the protocol-level optimizations worth doing instead
(send-buffer pool + handle cache, ack pipelining) with an A/B benchmark
plan against the current implementation.

## Follow-up round 8 — v0.5.10.post1 full `--full` matrix + cutover (2026-05-21, RunPod 4×H100)

Round 5 validated `v0.5.10.post1/colocate.patch` at tp=1 and
engine_tp_size=2. This round runs the **complete `run_smoke_host.sh
--full` matrix** against v0.5.10 and cuts the colocate default over to
it.

### Full matrix — GREEN on 4×H100

`run_smoke_host.sh --full` with `SGLANG_PATCH_VERSION=v0.5.10.post1` on
a RunPod 4×H100 pod (branch HEAD `4fce80d`). All 13 tests across 9
files pass:

```
test_phase4_tiny_one_step                   PASSED
test_phase7_tiny_loss_decreases             PASSED  (loss 12.02 → 9.74)
test_phase4_one_step_completes_end_to_end   PASSED  (4-GPU, 4-engine Qwen3-8B)
test_phase7_grad_parity_smoke               PASSED
test_phase7_grad_parity_determinism         PASSED
test_phase7_grad_parity_full                PASSED
test_colocate_checkpoint_save / _resume     PASSED
test_colocate_ipc_*                         PASSED
test_colocate_engine_tp2_end_to_end         PASSED  (engine_tp_size=2)
test_colocate_multi_engine_tp2_end_to_end   PASSED  (2 engines × tp=2)
test_phase6_peak_alloc_flatness             PASSED  (200 steps)
test_phase7_convergence_loss_decreases      PASSED
```

It took two runs. The first stopped at `test_phase7_grad_parity_smoke`
with `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` from the HF Hub (unauthenticated
Qwen3-8B metadata fetch) — an environment rate-limit, **not** a patch
bug; `test_phase4_one_step` (4-engine Qwen3-8B) had already passed in
that run. The second run set `HF_TOKEN` and ran the remaining 7 files
(skipping the 2 already green) — 10/10 passed.

### Cutover — v0.5.10.post1 is now the default (`092b68f`)

With v0.5.10 fully validated, the colocate default was repointed off
v0.5.8.post1:

* `run_smoke_host.sh` — `SGLANG_COMMIT` / `SGLANG_PATCH_VERSION` defaults.
* `apply_sglang_patch.sh` — `--colocate` defaults to v0.5.10.post1
  (the now-redundant per-mode version branch was collapsed).
* `modal_colocate_smoke.py` — `SGLANG_COMMIT` / `SGLANG_PATCH_VERSION`.

v0.5.8.post1 stays selectable via `SGLANG_PATCH_VERSION=v0.5.8.post1`
but is no longer the maintained target — future colocate patch work
lands in v0.5.10.post1 directly, ending the forward-port treadmill.

### Still open

* `pp_size>1` — blocked by an explicit guard in the colocate patch;
  out of scope for the current colocate plan.
* A TorchSpec-side `_init_rope` fix (transformers `rope_type="default"`,
  commit `be399a0`) was needed for the matrix to run on a
  current-transformers environment — not part of the sglang patch.

---

## Follow-up round 9 — CUDA IPC default hang: diagnosed & fixed (2026-05-21, RunPod 1×H100)

Round 7 flipped the default transport to CUDA IPC but flagged the
`--full` IPC-default run as not-yet-done. That run was attempted on a
4×H100 pod and **hung** at colocate training-loop step 0 — every actor
finished init, then froze before the first hidden-state transfer.

### Isolation (1×H100, colocate tiny config, 1 step each)

| Config | Result |
|---|---|
| gloo + `expandable_segments` | PASS — `step=1, loss=12.02` |
| gloo − `expandable_segments` | PASS → **`expandable_segments` ruled out** |
| CUDA IPC, probe runs | **HANG** at step 0 |
| CUDA IPC, probe skipped | PASS — `loss=12.02` |
| CUDA IPC, non-destructive probe (the fix) | PASS — `loss=12.02` |

Connector/fetcher instrumentation confirmed both sides agree on
`_use_ipc=True`, and `connector.send` / `recv_step` (hence
`ipc_send` / `ipc_recv`) are **never reached** — the engine wedges
inside sglang's `generate()` forward, upstream of the transport.

### Root cause

`probe_ipc_capability()` ran a `reduce_tensor()` smoke test on a scratch
CUDA tensor at connector/fetcher construction. `reduce_tensor()` shares
the tensor via CUDA IPC; the probe then discarded it with no consumer
ever mapping it. That leaves PyTorch's CUDA-IPC producer-side machinery
in a state that wedges subsequent CUDA work **under MPS** — the engine's
next forward hangs. The transport itself is innocent: once the probe is
skipped, `ipc_send` / `ipc_recv` carry the step correctly — the IPC loss
is **bit-identical** to gloo (`12.021415908336417`).

### Fix (`e166c21`)

`probe_ipc_capability()` no longer calls `reduce_tensor()`. The only
capability that matters for the classic container-friendly handle path
is that memory is not `expandable_segments`; that is now checked from
`PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF` / `PYTORCH_ALLOC_CONF` — a non-destructive
config check. `ensure_ipc_usable()` still fails fast. `test_cuda_ipc.py`
13/13. GPU-verified: IPC-default colocate tiny passes with the real
fixed probe.

### Note

Round 8's `--full` (at `4fce80d`, the gloo-default branch) reported
`test_colocate_ipc` green, yet the probe hang reproduced on **3 separate
pods** here — the CUDA-IPC-under-MPS interaction appears host/driver
dependent. The non-destructive probe removes the destructive call
outright, so it is strictly safer regardless.

### Second bug — expandable_segments inherited by the IPC engine

The first `--full` re-run surfaced one more bug. `test_colocate_tiny.py`
sets `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` in the
`train_entry` driver env; the engine actor **inherits** it, and CUDA IPC
genuinely cannot use expandable_segments memory on a no-`CAP_SYS_PTRACE`
container. The round-9 probe correctly rejected it (`ensure_ipc_usable`
raised) — but `factory.py` / `train_group.py` only *skipped adding*
expandable_segments for IPC actors; they did not *override* the
inherited value. Fixed (`e62c941`): the IPC branch now
actively sets `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:False`.

### `--full` re-validation — GREEN (2026-05-21, RunPod 4×H100)

With both fixes, **13 colocate tests pass under CUDA IPC default**:
`test_phase4_tiny_one_step`, `test_phase7_tiny_loss_decreases`,
`test_phase4_one_step` (4-GPU / 4-engine Qwen3-8B), grad parity
(determinism / full / vs-disagg), checkpoint save+resume,
`test_colocate_ipc`, `test_colocate_tp2`, `test_colocate_multi_engine`,
`test_phase6_peak_alloc_flatness` (200 steps), `test_phase7_convergence`
(50 steps, loss 12.13 → 3.27). The one non-pass — `grad_parity_smoke`
(Qwen3-8B) — was an HF-Hub `429` rate-limit on the unauthenticated model
metadata fetch (environment, not a colocate defect; `test_phase4_one_step`
already exercised 4-GPU Qwen3-8B under IPC). The Qwen0.6B tests were
re-run with `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` against the warm model cache to dodge the
same rate-limit.

**Real-workload CUDA IPC performance:** a warm colocate step is ~0.18 s;
the hidden-state transfer is ~1 % of that (round-7 benchmark: ~1–2 ms),
so CUDA IPC is not a step-time factor. `peak_alloc` stayed flat to
0.014 % over the 200-step stability test — the per-step IPC handle
export/open does not leak. Detail in
`docs/colocate/transport_benchmark.md`.
