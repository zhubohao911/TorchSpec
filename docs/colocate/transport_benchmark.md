## TL;DR

For realistic colocate hidden-state payloads, **CUDA IPC is ~170× faster
than gloo CPU-staging** — the Eagle3-shaped 160 MB case transfers in
**1.9 ms** over CUDA IPC vs **319 ms** over gloo. The speedup widens with
payload size: gloo's CPU-staged path is bottlenecked at ~0.5 GB/s, while
CUDA IPC stays ≈1 ms almost flat because the only real data movement is a
single on-device D→D copy. This is the measured justification for making
CUDA IPC the default transport.

The one exception is **tiny payloads (<~3 MB)**, where IPC is marginally
slower (0.5–0.8×) — its fixed handshake + `cudaIpcOpenMemHandle` cost
(~1 ms) dominates. Colocate hidden states are tens-to-hundreds of MB, so
that regime never applies in practice.

## End-to-end transfer latency

Barrier-to-barrier end-to-end transfer (engine send + trainer recv/copy);
8 warmup + 40 measured iterations; a fresh payload allocated every
iteration (so CUDA IPC pays a real `cudaIpcOpenMemHandle` each time).

## Engine / trainer split (own-call duration, mean)

## Per-stage breakdown — single 256 MB

| Stage | Time |
|---|--:|
| `gloo.engine D->H copy` | 176.791 ms |
| `gloo.engine gloo ship` | 272.904 ms |
| `gloo.trainer gloo recv` | 459.425 ms |
| `gloo.trainer H->D copy` | 34.673 ms |
| `ipc.engine handle export` | 0.203 ms |
| `ipc.engine ship handles` | 0.293 ms |
| `ipc.engine wait for ack` | 1.259 ms |
| `ipc.trainer handle open` | 0.518 ms |
| `ipc.trainer D->D copy` | 0.264 ms |

## Interpretation

- **gloo is bottlenecked by its own transport, not by PCIe.** The 256 MB
  breakdown shows the gloo ship (`dist.send`/`recv` over gloo's TCP
  transport on localhost) at ~270–460 ms — only ~0.5–0.9 GB/s. Even the
  engine's pageable D→H copy is slow (~177 ms ≈ 1.4 GB/s). gloo is built
  for small control-plane collectives, not bulk tensor transfer; the
  colocate gloo path inherits that ceiling.
- **CUDA IPC is near-constant-time.** 64 MB → 0.77 ms, 256 MB → 0.82 ms.
  The actual D→D copy is **0.26 ms for 256 MB** (~1 TB/s effective). The
  dominant IPC cost is the fixed handshake — `cudaIpcOpenMemHandle`
  (~0.5 ms) plus the ack round-trip — so IPC latency is essentially
  payload-size-independent across the whole colocate range.
- **Crossover is ~3–4 MB.** Below it, IPC's fixed overhead loses to gloo;
  above it IPC wins by a widening margin. Real Eagle3 hidden states (the
  160 MB case) sit deep in IPC-favorable territory → **170×**.
- **Per-step impact.** In the serial colocate loop (engine produces →
  transfer → trainer trains) the transfer is pure stall. Replacing a
  ~300 ms gloo stall with a ~2 ms IPC stall removes the hidden-state
  transfer as a step-time factor entirely.

### Caveats

- Measured **without MPS** (the benchmark spawns two plain processes).
  Real colocate runs under MPS, which changes kernel-scheduling
  concurrency, not the transport mechanism — and the transfer is serial
  (engine sends while trainer waits), so there is little kernel overlap
  to gain. The headline ratio holds.
- The gloo arm uses pageable host memory (`.to("cpu")`), matching the
  current `NcclHiddenStatesConnector`. Pinned host memory would speed
  gloo's copies somewhat but not its TCP ship, which is the dominant term.
- IPC re-pays `cudaIpcOpenMemHandle` every step because the engine
  reallocates hidden states each step. A handle cache keyed by device
  pointer is a possible future optimization, but at ~0.5 ms it is not
  currently a bottleneck. See [`transport_optimization.md`](transport_optimization.md)
  for the full protocol-level optimization plan (send-buffer pool +
  handle cache, ack pipelining) and how to A/B it against this baseline.

## Reproduce

```bash
# Any 1-GPU host; no `pip install` needed — bench_transport.py loads
# cuda_ipc.py directly and runs on a bare torch install.
python scripts/colocate/bench_transport.py
python scripts/colocate/bench_transport.py --iters 40 --warmup 8 --sizes-mb 1,16,256
```
