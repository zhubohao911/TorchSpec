"""Phase 7 — short-run convergence (slow).

Plan reference: ``implementation.md`` §Phase 7, "Short-horizon
convergence: 1k step training loss curve overlaps within 2% of the
disaggregated baseline."

This is the slow (``@pytest.mark.slow``) counterpart to
``test_grad_parity.py``. Two tests:

* ``test_phase7_convergence_loss_decreases`` — runs a short colocate
  training horizon and asserts the loss curve trends downward (i.e.,
  training is making real progress — not a no-op or constant signal).
* ``test_convergence_disagg_overlap`` — the plan's literal ask: run the
  colocate tiny config and the disaggregated (Mooncake) tiny config for
  the same horizon, same seed, same data order, and assert the two loss
  curves overlap within ~2 %. Both arms train the identical draft model
  on identical batches; the only difference is the hidden-state
  transport (CUDA IPC colocate vs Mooncake disagg), so an overlapping
  loss curve is the end-to-end signal that the colocate transport
  converges like the disaggregated baseline. Skips cleanly if Mooncake
  cannot run on the host.

Both tests parse the env-gated ``[loss_curve] step=N loss=V`` log line
emitted by *both* training loops (``controller/loop.py`` and
``controller/colocate_loop.py``) when ``TORCHSPEC_LOSS_CURVE_LOG`` is
set — an identical format on both sides so the curves are directly
comparable.

Default horizon: 50 steps. Override with ``PHASE7_CONVERGE_STEPS``
(the plan's reference is 1000 but that's an hour of compute under
MPS; CI only needs to see a clear downward trend). The overlap
tolerance defaults to 2 % — override with ``CONVERGE_OVERLAP_PCT``.
