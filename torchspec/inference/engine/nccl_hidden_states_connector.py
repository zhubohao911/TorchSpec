"""Engine-side multi-tensor NCCL P2P sender for colocate mode (Phase 4).

This is the engine-side counterpart to ``NcclDataFetcher`` /
``NcclMultiTensorFetcher`` on the trainer. It mirrors what the disaggregated
``MooncakeHiddenStatesConnector`` does (write hidden states to a shared
Mooncake store keyed by ``mooncake_key``), but the wire is a single NCCL
``batch_isend_irecv`` to the paired trainer rank instead of a TCP write
to a remote Mooncake server.

Wire protocol
-------------

Per training step, the engine produces a per-request ``Dict[str, Tensor]``.
The exact key set depends on the draft model:

- Eagle3 with last_hidden_states + target_logits:
  ``{"hidden_states", "aux_hidden_states", "last_hidden_states",
     "target_logits"}``
- Eagle3 without last_hidden_states (older configs):
  ``{"hidden_states", "aux_hidden_states", "target_logits"}``
- DFlash variants: as defined by the draft trainer.

The connector sends the tensors in **sorted-by-key** order via a single
``dist.batch_isend_irecv`` call. The receiver
(:class:`torchspec.training.nccl_data_fetcher.NcclMultiTensorFetcher`)
must agree on this ordering — it does, because it uses the same sort.

Pairing
-------

Each engine rank ``i`` (in ``[0, N)`` of the engine role, i.e. global rank
``N+i`` in the union world) is paired with trainer rank ``i`` (global rank
``i``). The connector therefore needs only its own engine role rank and
the union-world ``UnionWorld`` handle to pick the destination:

    dst_global_rank = paired_global_rank  # held on UnionWorld

Within an engine TP group, the engine's TP rank-0 worker is the canonical
sender (sglang's spec_training callback runs there). For TP > 1 the
local-shard split happens **upstream** of this connector (the sglang patch
slices the global-batch hidden states by TP rank before invoking the
callback). This connector is intentionally TP-unaware.

Layering
--------

This module **does not** depend on sglang. It's a pure
``torch.distributed`` library function that the upstream sglang patch
calls. The patch lives outside this repo (see
``docs/colocate/sglang_patch.md`` for the patch surface). When the
``transfer_mode == 'nccl'`` flag is set on ``SglEngine``, sgl_engine.py
exports an env marker (:data:`TRANSFER_MODE_ENV`) and a destination-rank
table; the patch reads them and instantiates this connector.
