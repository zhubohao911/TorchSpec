"""CUDA IPC zero-copy hidden-state transport for colocate mode.

This is the **default** colocate hidden-state transport. The engine
exports a CUDA IPC handle for each hidden-state tensor (via PyTorch's
``torch.multiprocessing`` reduction machinery), ships the small handle
blobs over the gloo channel, and the trainer maps the engine's GPU
memory directly and does a single on-device D->D copy into its own
buffer. No host round-trip.

The fallback is the gloo CPU-staged transport: the engine does a D->H
copy, ships the bytes over the gloo ``meta_group``, and the trainer
does an H->D copy — two PCIe-class copies per tensor per step. Both
processes share the *same physical GPU* under MPS, so that host
round-trip is pure overhead (the data never needs to leave the device)
— which is exactly what this IPC path eliminates.

Default & opt-out
-----------------
CUDA IPC is **on by default**, layered on top of ``transfer_mode=nccl``
(it replaces only the gloo transport, not the union-world bootstrap).
Set ``TORCHSPEC_COLOCATE_IPC=0`` to fall back to the gloo CPU-staged
transport. Both the engine connector and the trainer fetcher read the
*same* env var, so the two sides always agree on the transport without
a runtime negotiation message.

The ``expandable_segments`` conflict
------------------------------------
CUDA IPC has two memory-sharing paths. For plain ``cudaMalloc`` memory
it uses the classic ``cudaIpcGetMemHandle`` / ``cudaIpcOpenMemHandle``
handles, which work in any container. For the virtual-memory segments
produced by ``expandable_segments:True`` it instead passes the backing
fd between processes via the ``pidfd_getfd`` syscall — and that needs
``CAP_SYS_PTRACE``, which typical containers (RunPod, most Docker
hosts) do not grant, so ``rebuild_cuda_tensor`` fails with
``pidfd_getfd: Operation not permitted``.

Resolution: when ``TORCHSPEC_COLOCATE_IPC`` is opted in, the colocate
path (``ray/train_group.py``, ``inference/factory.py``) **does not**
inject ``expandable_segments`` into the trainer/engine actors, so IPC
stays on the capability-free classic-handle path. (IPC already avoids
the H<->D staging churn that ``expandable_segments`` was mitigating.)

:func:`probe_ipc_capability` runs a **non-destructive** capability check
at construction (it does *not* share a CUDA tensor — a ``reduce_tensor``
smoke test wedges CUDA under MPS; see that function's docstring). The
connector/fetcher **fail fast** with an actionable message if IPC is
unavailable, rather than silently falling back (a one-sided fallback
would desync the wire protocol).

Wire protocol
-------------
Per step, engine -> trainer over the gloo group:

  1. engine: ``send_object_list([[(name, ipc_args), ...]])`` — the
     pickled IPC handle blobs, in ``sorted(name)`` order.
  2. trainer: ``recv_object_list`` -> rebuild each tensor as an alias of
     the engine's memory -> ``.clone()`` into a trainer-owned buffer ->
     ``cuda.synchronize()``.
  3. trainer: send a 1-byte ack back.
  4. engine: block on the ack before returning from ``send`` — this
     keeps the engine's (sglang-owned) hidden-state tensors alive until
     the trainer has finished copying, exactly like the blocking gloo
     ``send`` it replaces.

    The plain :func:`ipc_send` / :func:`ipc_recv` pair is stateless: every
    step exports a fresh IPC handle and the engine blocks on the trainer's
    ack inside ``send()``. This class is the optimized alternative
    (``TORCHSPEC_COLOCATE_IPC_PIPELINE=1``) — it carries state across
    steps and implements both protocol-level optimizations from
    ``docs/colocate/transport_optimization.md``:

    * **Send-buffer pool (Opt 1).** The engine owns ``K = 2`` persistent
      CUDA buffers per tensor name. Each step it copies the engine's
      transient hidden states into ``pool[step % K]`` (one D->D copy) and
      exports that *pooled* buffer's IPC handle. Pool buffers have stable
      device pointers, so their handle args are computed **once** and the
      trainer opens each handle (``cudaIpcOpenMemHandle``) **once**,
      caching the mapping for every later step.

    * **Ack pipelining (Opt 2).** The trainer acks with a non-blocking
      ``isend``; the engine collects the *previous* step's ack instead of
      this step's, so the ~1 ms ack round-trip overlaps the engine's next
      forward instead of stalling ``send()``. ``K = 2`` guarantees step N
      never lands in the slot whose step N-1 ack is still outstanding.

    Variable ``seq_len`` is handled by sizing each pool buffer to the
    largest payload seen so far (grow-to-fit, sized *exactly* — no x2
    overshoot, which on a memory-tight config stacks unaffordably with
    sglang's KV cache). A resize re-exports that slot's handle (the
    trainer re-opens it once) and *retires* the old buffer; the retired
    buffer is freed one step later, the moment the trainer acks the
    resize step — by then it has re-opened the new handle and dropped its
    mapping of the old one, so the free can never race a live mapping and
    a variable-``seq_len`` run does not accumulate dead pool buffers.

    **Teardown is drain-safe without an explicit flush.** The engine never
    blocks on the final ack: an un-collected ack would only matter to
    guard a step N+2 that never happens, and the trainer has already
    ``cuda.synchronize()``-d its copy before sending it, so the engine
    freeing its pool on exit cannot corrupt anything. The trainer waits
    its previous ``isend`` before each new one, so at most one 1-byte ack
    is ever in flight. :meth:`flush` waits that last ``isend`` for a tidy
    teardown; skipping it is harmless.

    One instance per :class:`NcclHiddenStatesConnector` (``role="engine"``)
    or :class:`NcclMultiTensorFetcher` (``role="trainer"``). The class has
    no torchspec-internal imports so the transport benchmark
    (``scripts/colocate/bench_transport.py``) can load this module
